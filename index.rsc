e:T2869,# Component-Potential Peeling at Score 7,249,456,451

## Abstract

For `m=2`, `p=147457`, and total degree `d=87`, a component-aware peeling potential lowers the verified score from `7349491214` to

\[
A=7249456451,
\qquad \varepsilon=\frac{A}{p^2}=0.3334069567033068\ldots .
\]

The proof retains the incumbent three-direction interpolation and primitive cleanup, but peels lines at degree at most `k=4415`. Exact affine mixing shows that every surviving component below density `ε/10` contributes at least `66772609` incidences of negative potential. Acceptance above the resulting frontier therefore forces a sufficiently large component. Simple-root reconstruction then gives one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial on at least `724945646` points.

## Test and Notation

Let `F=F_147457`, `h=p+1=147458`,

\[
M=p^2=21743566849,\quad \Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306,
\quad N=Mh=3206262880419842.
\]

The test samples a uniform affine line and then a uniform point on it, hence is uniform on the `N` incidences. Let `E` be the accepted-incidence graph and `ρ=|E|/N`.

Set

\[
D=15129,\quad q=D-87=15042,\quad k=4415,
\quad E_D=2615604,
\]

and

\[
\kappa=\frac{1610629120}{10871857153}.
\]

## Prior Results

The active submissions, leaderboards, message board, and verifier audits were inspected with every `superseded` directory excluded. The verified incumbent and its exact chain are in [researcher-0003/note.md](/Users/kaizheng/.codex/worktrees/1f44/SSE-auto/Line-vs-Point-concrete/research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0003/note.md:1), with the accepting [audit](/Users/kaizheng/.codex/worktrees/1f44/SSE-auto/Line-vs-Point-concrete/research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/reviews/researcher-0003/verifier-a-researcher-0003/audit.json:1). The authoritative imported record is in [soundness-history.json](/Users/kaizheng/.codex/worktrees/1f44/SSE-auto/Line-vs-Point-concrete/research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/leaderboards/soundness-history.json:1).

The present proof reproduces the needed interpolation, cleanup, mixing, and reconstruction arguments; no primary-source theorem is imported. KTZ revision-1 Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 are analogous interfaces but are not load-bearing dependencies here.

## Theorem

For every `f:F^2→F` and every assignment of a degree-at-most-87 polynomial to each affine line, if

\[
\operatorname{Pass}(f,P)\ge \frac{7249456451}{21743566849},
\]

then some `Q∈F[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` satisfies

\[
\Pr_x[Q(x)=f(x)]\ge
\max\left\{\frac{174}{147457},
\frac{7249456451}{217435668490}\right\}
=\frac{7249456451}{217435668490}.
\]

Consequently `Q` agrees with `f` on at least `724945646` points.

## Proof

### [P1] Field and incidence arithmetic — proved

The factorization `p−1=2^14·3^2`, together with

\[
10^{p-1}=1,\quad 10^{(p-1)/2}=p-1,\quad
10^{(p-1)/3}=78348\pmod p
\]

and the two corresponding Pocklington gcds equal to one proves primality. Standard affine-plane counting gives `M,Λ,N` above.

### [P2] Three-direction coverage — proved

For a point of accepted degree `a`, a uniform three-direction set misses its accepted pencil with probability

\[
H_a=\binom{h-a}{3}/\binom h3.
\]

The integer maximum of `aH_a/(h−a)` occurs at `a=49152`, giving

\[
aH_a\le \kappa(h-a).
\]

Averaging therefore selects three complete directions whose uncovered accepted incidences satisfy

\[
U\le \kappa(1-\rho)N.
\]

### [P3] Interpolation — proved

The number of `(1,1,87)`-weighted monomials of weight at most `D` is

\[
\sum_{z=0}^{173}\binom{D-87z+2}{2}=6693082347,
\]

whereas the `3p=442371` selected line graphs impose at most

\[
442371(D+1)=6693073230
\]

constraints. A nonzero interpolant `A(X,Y,Z)` exists. It depends on `Z`, since a `Z`-independent polynomial of degree at most `D` cannot contain more than `D` distinct line factors. Choosing minimum weighted degree makes `A` squarefree. Moreover `deg_Z(A)<=173<p`, so `A_Z` is nonzero.

### [P4] Identity extension and cleanup — proved

Let `t` be the number of formal identity lines. Every omitted line has at most `D` covered accepted points, so

\[
|E|\le U+D(\Lambda-t)+|E_T|.
\]

Write `A=HB`, with `H` the coefficient content and `B` primitive in `Z`. Squarefreeness, primitivity, and `deg_Z(B)<p` give `gcd(B,B_Z)=1`. The nominal projective discriminant bounds content or derivative-degenerate identity lines by

\[
E_D=172(2D-87\cdot173)=2615604.
\]

If `z<=E_D` is their number, each remaining identity line has at most `q=D−87=15042` derivative-zero accepted points. Thus, for the cleaned graph `G` on `n=t−z` regular lines,

\[
|E_T|\le pz+q(t-z)+|E(G)|.
\]

### [P5] Exact affine mixing — proved

For `X⊆F^2`, `S` a line set, put `a=|X|/M` and `ℓ=|S|/Λ`. Ordered-pair counting gives

\[
\sum_L(|X\cap L|-ap)^2=p^3a(1-a).
\]

Centering the indicator of `S` and applying Cauchy–Schwarz yields

\[
\frac{I(X,S)}N\le a\ell+
\sqrt{\frac{a(1-a)\ell(1-\ell)}h}. \tag{1}
\]

### [P6] Component-potential inequality — proved

Put `δ=D/h` and `θ=k/p`. For `η>=0`, set `δ'=δ−η`,

\[
Q_\eta=4\delta'(\delta'-1)+1/h,
\quad L_\eta(a)=4\delta'\theta-1/h+Q_\eta a,
\]

\[
R_\eta(a)=\theta+(2\delta'-1)a.
\]

The maximum over `0<=ℓ<=1` of the right side of (1) minus `δa+θℓ` equals

\[
\frac{a-\theta+
\sqrt{(a-\theta)^2+a(1-a)/h}}2-\delta a.
\]

If `R_η(a)>=0` and `L_η(a)>=0`, squaring proves

\[
I(X,S)\le D|X|+k|S|-\eta h|X|. \tag{2}
\]

Take

\[
\eta_1=512709/5000000,
\quad a_0=1/6800,
\quad \eta_2=1/7000,
\quad \tau=A/(10M).
\]

Both `Q_η` are negative. Exact endpoint checks are

\[
L_{\eta_1}(a_0)=
\frac{41436535638699821004697}
{34066774131425322500000000000000}>0,
\]

\[
R_{\eta_1}(a_0)=
\frac{5506553545490942523}{184821571601000000000}>0,
\]

\[
L_{\eta_2}(\tau)=
\frac{1125384432788401834891}
{14479166549516565012602500000}>0,
\]

\[
R_{\eta_2}(\tau)=
\frac{192575713292549221}{56109600407347235000}>0.
\]

Thus (2) holds with `η1` for `a<=a0` and with `η2` for `a0<=a<=τ`.

### [P7] Component-aware peeling — proved

Peel points of current degree at most `D` and lines of current degree at most `k`. A nonempty residual component has at least `k+1=4416` points. If its point density is below `τ`, its potential is at most

\[
-\left\lceil\eta_1h(4416)\right\rceil=-66772609
\]

in the small range, or at most

\[
-\left\lceil\eta_2a_0N\right\rceil=-67358464
\]

in the large range.

If the peel empties, the C4-free residual-corner calculation gives `Z<=550550` and empty-core credit

\[
2Dk-Z=133038520>66772609.
\]

(The `n<D` boundary equals `M+k(D−1)−133038520=21677318449>0`.) Therefore, if no residual component reaches density `τ`, uniformly

\[
|E(G)|\le DM+k(t-z)-66772609. \tag{3}
\]

### [P8] Survival — proved

Combining [P2], [P4], and (3), and using the positive coefficients

\[
q+k-D=4328,
\qquad p-q-k=128000,
\]

gives

\[
|E|\le U+C,
\]

where

\[
C=(q+k)\Lambda+DM+(p-q-k)E_D-66772609
\]

\[
=423067449251842+328958422858521
+334797312000-66772609
=752360602649754.
\]

Thus absence of a large component implies

\[
\rho\le \frac CN+\kappa(1-\rho),
\]

whose frontier is

\[
R=\frac{613678839472717}{1840629978357761}.
\]

At `ε=A/M`,

\[
\varepsilon-\frac CN-\kappa(1-\varepsilon)
=\frac{4190366454}{236392952779034320897}>0.
\]

Hence a component of point density at least `τ` survives.

### [P9] Polynomial reconstruction — proved

Every residual point has at least `D+1` accepted simple-root identity lines. At one point, homogeneous implicit recursion through degree `87`, dividing only by its nonzero `B_Z`, constructs `Q` of total degree at most `87`. Its restrictions equal the labels on `D+1` seed lines. Since `B(X,Y,Q)` has degree at most `D` and vanishes on more than `D` lines, it is identically zero. Simple-root uniqueness propagates the same `Q` through the connected component. Thus `Q=f` on every component point.

### [P10] Contract and score — proved

Exact subtraction gives

\[
\varepsilon-\frac{957}{1474570}
=\frac{72353448161}{217435668490}>0,
\]

\[
\frac\varepsilon{10}-\frac{174}{147457}
=\frac{6992881271}{217435668490}>0.
\]

Thus the required maximum is `ε/10`, and its integer count is

\[
\left\lceil A/10\right\rceil=724945646.
\]

Finally `ceil(εp²)=A=7249456451`, improving `7349491214` by `100034763`.

## Soundness Ledger

| Stage | Exact loss or credit |
|---|---:|
| three-direction coverage | `κ(1−ρ)N` |
| identity extension | `D(Λ−t)` |
| exceptional identities | `pz`, `z<=2615604` |
| derivative roots | `15042(t−z)` |
| point/line peeling | `DM+4415(t−z)` |
| no-good-component credit | `−66772609` |
| fixed subtotal | `C=752360602649754` |
| component conversion | one centered Cauchy–Schwarz bound |
| reconstruction | zero agreement loss |
| final contract | factor `1/10`; `724945646` points |

There is no Markov, union-bound, randomized-computation, or hidden reconstruction loss.

## Counterexample Attempts

The direct `s=5194` endpoint remains negative, so minimum degrees alone do not certify the target. Exact `k=4414` potential arithmetic also fails: its component-compatible score ceiling is `7249018675`, versus survival score `7249328431`. These failures motivated the component-potential charge rather than an unsupported endpoint repair.

## Characteristic Audit

All derivative degrees are below `p`; nominal discriminants avoid leading-coefficient division; root counts apply only to nonzero polynomials; reconstruction uses formal identities and nonzero first derivatives. Total degree `87` is preserved throughout.

## Limitations

The result is only for the fixed bivariate prime-field instance and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling. No global optimality is claimed. Score `7249456451` is the smallest certified by the displayed `k=4415` two-range potential package; `k=4414` is an obstruction only for this package.

## Team Handoff

f:T1d05,# Label-Sensitive Surplus Interpolation Lowers the Fixed Score by 779

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, the verified incumbent selects three complete directions and leaves an interpolation kernel of dimension at least `9117`. I spend `9116` of these dimensions on the actual labels of the heaviest points not covered by the selected directions. This reduces the uncovered-incidence coefficient from

\[
\kappa=\frac{1610629120}{10871857153}
\]

to

\[
\kappa'=\left(1-\frac{9116}{21743566849}\right)\kappa
=\frac{35020807257170984960}{236392952779034320897}.
\]

The resulting terminating trigger is

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{3380075810946357}{10^{16}},
\]

with score `7349490435`, improving the incumbent `7349491214` by `779`.

The imported record is the doubly verified campaign-30 theorem in `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0003/response.json`, theorem SHA-256 `53c9e438528bd0576c18932996e7607f719d4f9e051243f15e86889aae6b4762`.

\[
6693082347-442371\cdot15130=9117.
\]

The sensitivity and partial-direction obstruction are recorded in `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0001/response.json`. The present proof uses the self-contained version of the incumbent modules, so it has no load-bearing primary-paper dependency.

## Theorem

Let `p=147457`, `d=87`, and `epsilon=3380075810946357/10^16`. Every point table and every affine-line table of univariate degree at most `87` with acceptance at least `epsilon` admit a polynomial in `F_p[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` agreeing with the point table on more than `epsilon/10` of `F_p²`.

## Proof

[P1, proved] The verified three-direction averaging lemma supplies three directions whose `3p=442371` lines leave uncovered accepted-incidence mass

\[
U\le \kappa(1-\rho)N.
\]

[P2, proved] Choose the `k=9116` largest weights `a_x` among uncovered points, or every uncovered point if there are fewer. For nonnegative weights totaling `U` on at most `M` points, their top `k` values total at least `kU/M`. After declaring these points covered, the residual mass satisfies

\[
U'\le\left(1-\frac{k}{M}\right)U
\le\kappa'(1-\rho)N.
\]

[P3, proved] Impose the original formal identities on the `442371` selected labeled lines and additionally impose `A(x,f(x))=0` at the selected points. Weighted degree `D=15129` gives `6693082347` monomials. The line identities impose at most `6693073230` equations and the point labels impose at most `9116`, leaving dimension at least one.

Every nonzero solution is Z-dependent. Choose one of minimum weighted degree. Dividing out one copy of a repeated irreducible factor preserves every formal line identity and every added point zero. The incumbent repeated-factor argument also preserves a nonzero Z-derivative. Minimality therefore gives a squarefree `A` with `A_Z` nonzero and `deg_Z A≤173<p`.

[P4, proved] Redefine a covered point to mean either a point hit by an accepted selected-direction line or one of the additional labeled points. At every covered point, `A(x,f(x))=0`. Hence any unselected line containing more than `D` covered accepted points is an A-identity line. The identity-extension inequality becomes

\[
|E|\le |E_T|+U'+D(\Lambda-|T|).
\]

[P5, proved] The verified primitive cleanup, nominal-discriminant estimate, and C4-free peeling apply unchanged. Their parameters are

\[
q=D-d=15042,\quad E_D=2615604,
\]

line threshold `s=5195`, and peeling credit `156513678`. Complete deletion would imply

\[
\rho\le \frac{C_*}{N}+\kappa'(1-\rho),
\qquad C_*=769296828797543.
\]

[P6, proved] The strict frontier is

\[
R'=\frac{C_*/N+\kappa'}{1+\kappa'}
=\frac{61159938999447089357}{180942506690803537238}.
\]

At the claimed terminating epsilon,

\[
\varepsilon-\frac{C_*}{N}-\kappa'(1-\varepsilon)
=\frac{64670249872480163804912949}
{2363929527790343208970000000000000000}>0.
\]

Thus a nonempty `(15130,5195)` simple-root core survives.

[P7, proved] The incumbent affine-incidence component argument applies with `tau=epsilon/10`. Its endpoint polynomial satisfies `F(tau)>0`, `F'(tau)<0`, and `F''=2(1-1/h)>0`; hence every connected core component contains more than `tau M` points. The incumbent formal implicit-lifting and propagation argument then produces one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial agreeing throughout that component.

Finally,

\[
\frac{\varepsilon}{10}-\frac{174}{147457}
=\frac{481015838854716964149}{14745700000000000000000}>0.
\]

Therefore the required maximum is `epsilon/10=3380075810946357/10^17`, and

\[
\left\lceil\varepsilon M\right\rceil=7349490435,
\qquad
\left\lceil\frac{\varepsilon M}{10}\right\rceil=734949044.
\]

This proves the theorem.

## Counterexample Attempts

Three noncollinear point pencils use the same `3p` line budget but give coefficient approximately `0.148148148093641`, worse than the incumbent. A two-direction/one-pencil/one-line hybrid gives approximately `0.148147310890715`, also worse. These exact negative results rule out the most economical pencil replacements.

## Characteristic Audit

All Z-degrees are at most `173<p`. Added point constraints introduce no derivative, discriminant, irreducibility, or interpolation-multiplicity issue. Repeated-factor removal preserves both line identities and point zeros. The inherited cleanup never divides by a specialized leading coefficient, and reconstruction divides only by a certified nonzero simple-root derivative.

## Limitations

The improvement uses only the guaranteed rank-nullity surplus. It does not prove an additional rank deficit, optimize multiplicity constraints, or improve the C4 corner. The campaign-10-frugal history file is presently empty; comparison is against the imported doubly verified campaign-30 record specified by the task.

10:T11eb,# Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, acceptance at least

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{7249403463}{21743566849}
\]

forces one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial to agree with the point table on at least `epsilon/10`, hence on at least `724940347` points. The score is `7249403463`, improving the verified incumbent by `100087751`.

# Test and Notation

Let `h=p+1`, `M=p²=21743566849`, `Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306`, and `N=Mh=3206262880419842`. The accepted-incidence density equals the test acceptance `rho`.

Use weighted degree `D=15136`, derivative cap `q=15049`, point peel cap `D`, and line peel cap `k=4414`. Select three complete directions and 408 lines of a fourth direction, then add the 3776 heaviest uncovered point labels.

# Prior Results

The verified incumbent and its accepted audit are `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0002/response.json` and `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/reviews/researcher-0002/verifier-a-researcher-0002/audit.json`. Component-potential peeling and labeled-point interpolation were independently retuned from the current frugal submissions of researchers 0001 and 0003.

# Theorem

Every point table and degree-at-most-87 affine-line table over `F_147457` with acceptance at least `7249403463/21743566849` admit one polynomial of total degree at most 87 agreeing on at least

\[
\max\left\{\frac{174}{147457},\frac{7249403463}{217435668490}\right\}
=\frac{7249403463}{217435668490}.
\]

# Proof or Conditional Proof

All steps are proved. The partial-fourth-direction miss probability at pencil degree `a` is

\[
\frac{\binom{h-a}{3}}{\binom h3}\left(1-\frac{408a}{p(h-3)}\right).
\]

Strict log-concavity and the neighboring differences certify its maximum at `a=49122`. Top-weight selection multiplies the resulting coefficient by `1−3776/M`.

There are `6702349500` eligible weighted monomials and only `442779·15137+3776=6702349499` equations. Minimum weighted degree gives a squarefree, Z-dependent relation with nonzero Z-derivative. Identity extension, coefficient-content removal, the nominal discriminant, and derivative root counting give exceptional cap `2618012` and regular-line cap `15049`.

For component densities `a,l`, centered affine mixing gives

\[
I/N\le a l+\sqrt{a(1-a)l(1-l)/h}.
\]

Writing `delta=D/h`, `theta=k/p`, maximizing over `l`, and squaring against `delta−eta` proves the potential inequality whenever the exact `L_eta` and `R_eta` quantities are nonnegative. With `a0=1/6800`, `eta1=25647317/250000000`, and `eta2=3/50000000`, the endpoint certificates are strictly positive. They give credits `66788391` and `28291`. The C4 empty-core corner gives the larger credit `133070051`; hence every no-large-component peel receives credit `28291`.

Collecting all losses gives `C=752643629163779`. With the augmented selector coefficient, absence of a component of density `epsilon/10` implies

\[
rho\le\frac{C/N+\kappa'_4}{1+\kappa'_4}
=\frac{3223268795561994597645042125366123}{9667741751820876581688555437077355}.
\]

Its product with `M` has floor `7249403462`, contradicting `rho≥epsilon`. A surviving simple-root component has point degree at least `D+1`. KTZ Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 give a single total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial throughout it.

# Soundness Ledger

Every numerical loss is listed in `soundness_ledger`. The final recovery is `epsilon/10`, not merely the obsolete `epsilon/10`-only contract: exact subtraction shows it exceeds `174/p`.

# Counterexample Attempts

The lower cap `k=4413` fails the component-potential endpoint exactly. Concentrated accepted directions are already covered by the pointwise selector envelope. Inseparability is excluded by `deg_Z<p`.

# Characteristic Audit

The fixed prime is Pocklington-certified. All derivative degrees are below `p`; no specialized leading coefficient is inverted; reconstruction divides only by a retained nonzero derivative.

# Limitations

Local optimality is only for the stated selector/potential neighborhood, not all architectures. The assigned checkpoint outbox was unexpectedly read-only: `apply_patch` rejected both the Markdown checkpoint and deterministic checker. The theorem itself does not depend on the exhaustive-search claim; all load-bearing rational identities are displayed here.

# Team Handoff

Builder 0007 should import `(D,r,c,k)=(15136,442779,3776,4414)`. Red-team 0009 should audit the selector and potential endpoints. Integrator 0010 should store the exact checker and bind the theorem hash before verification.
11:T1faa,# Spectral Component Floor Lowers the Fixed Score to 7,249,403,428

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, I strengthen the component-potential module of researcher-0004. Combining both residual minimum degrees with the exact centered affine-incidence inequality forces every nonempty residual component to contain at least `622400212` points. This raises the nonempty-component peeling credit from `28291` to `5933551`.

Spliced into the independently audited partial-fourth-direction proof, this gives

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{16}},\qquad
\left\lceil\varepsilon p^2\right\rceil=7249403428.
\]

The recovered polynomial agrees on at least `724940343` points. The score improves the verified `7349490435` record by `100087007` and researcher-0004’s pending score by `35`.

## Test and Notation

Let

\[
h=p+1=147458,\quad M=p^2=21743566849,
\]
\[
\Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306,\quad N=Mh=3206262880419842.
\]

The accepted-edge density is the prescribed test acceptance. Retain researcher-0004’s parameters

\[
D=15136,\quad k=4414,\quad q=D-d=15049,
\]

and selector coefficient

\[
\kappa'_4=
\frac{1246437422331006215441194309538667}
{8421304329489870366247361127538688}.
\]

## Prior Results

I scanned the 21 active submission notes, all active leaderboard files, 20 verifier audits, and both message boards, excluding every `superseded` directory. The authoritative history remains `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/leaderboards/soundness-history.json`.

The unchanged modules are researcher-0004 `[P2]`–`[P5]` and `[P9]` in `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0004/response.json`. Its audit at `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/reviews/researcher-0004/verifier-a-researcher-0004/audit.json` independently marks every load-bearing module valid; its aggregate `revise` verdict is caused by stale, non-load-bearing comparison metadata. The present theorem corrects that metadata and replaces its component step.

## Theorem

For every point table \(f:\mathbb F_{147457}^2\to\mathbb F_{147457}\) and every assignment of a degree-at-most-87 polynomial to every affine line, if

\[
\operatorname{Pass}(f,P)\ge
\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{16}},
\]

then some \(Q\in\mathbb F_{147457}[X,Y]\) of total degree at most `87` satisfies

\[
\Pr_x[Q(x)=f(x)]\ge
\max\left\{\frac{174}{147457},
\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{17}}\right\}
=rac{3334045181429561}{10^{17}}.
\]

## Proof

### [P1] Centered affine incidence bound — proved

For point and line sets of densities \(a,b\), ordered-pair counting gives

\[
\frac{I(X,S)}N\le ab+
\sqrt{\frac{a(1-a)b(1-b)}h}. \tag{1}
\]

### [P2] Spectral component floor — proved

Let a nonempty residual component have normalized edge mass \(J\), point density \(a\), and line density \(b\). Minimum degrees `(15137,4415)` give

\[
J\ge\alpha a,\quad J\ge\beta b,
\quad \alpha=\frac{15137}{147458},\quad
\beta=\frac{4415}{147457}.
\]

Put \(c=\alpha/\beta=2232056609/651027070\) and
\(\gamma^2=1/(ch)=4415/2232056609\). Applying (1) separately when \(b\le ca\) and \(b\ge ca\) yields, whenever \(ca<1/2\),

\[
\beta\le a+\gamma\sqrt{(1-a)(1-ca)}. \tag{2}
\]

Let \(a_*=622400211/M\) and

\[
F(a)=(\beta-a)^2-\gamma^2(1-a)(1-ca).
\]

Exact checks give

\[
F(a_*)=rac{84092949843}{3578280126216242515417889}>0,
\]

\[
F'(a_*)=-\frac{863766445687}{329134603449922}<0,
\]

\[
\beta-a_*=\frac{28622444}{21743566849}>0,
\quad
\frac12-ca_*=rac{19288988668294}{47999249330495}>0.
\]

Since \(F''=147457/73729>0\), `F` is decreasing throughout `[0,a*]`. Squaring (2) would require `F(a)≤0`, a contradiction. Thus every component has at least `622400212` points.

### [P3] Improved component potential — proved

Set

\[
\eta=\frac{40407}{625000000000},\quad
\delta=\frac D h,\quad \theta=\frac k p,
\]

and conservatively use \(\bar\tau=7249403428/(10M)\), which exceeds the theorem’s recovery density. Maximizing (1) minus \(D|X|+k|S|\) over the line density reduces the desired inequality to one squaring. With \(\delta'=\delta-\eta\), its guards are

\[
Q=4\delta'(\delta'-1)+1/h
=-\frac{195584747102179735885422401703791}
{530856000097656250000000000000000}<0,
\]

\[
L(\bar\tau)=
\frac{97794057801029066737011121001113}
{28856757313290348000244140625000000000000000}>0,
\]

\[
R(\bar\tau)=
\frac{4306203950438485321228529}
{1252446437664000781250000000}>0.
\]

Because `Q<0` and `2δ'−1<0`, these endpoint checks prove throughout the relevant interval

\[
I(X,S)\le D|X|+k|S|-\eta h|X|. \tag{3}
\]

By [P2], every nonempty component therefore contributes integer credit at least

\[
\left\lceil\eta h\cdot622400212\right\rceil=5933551.
\]

### [P4] Peeling dichotomy — proved

Sequentially peel points of degree at most `D` and lines of degree at most `k`. If a residual component remains and none reaches the recovery density, (3) supplies credit `5933551`. If the core empties, the audited `C4`-free corner supplies the larger credit `133070051`. Hence

\[
|E(G)|\le15136M+4414(t-z)-5933551. \tag{4}
\]

### [P5] Survival — proved

The audited selector, interpolation, identity-extension, and cleanup inequalities combine with (4). Since the coefficients of `t` and `z` are `4327` and `127994`, respectively,

\[
C'=423197911537678+329110627826464
+335089827928-5933551
=752643623258519.
\]

Absence of a large component would imply

\[
\rho\le C'/N+\kappa'_4(1-\rho).
\]

Its frontier is

\[
R'=rac{3223268780051728141186708743365483}
{9667741751820876581688555437077355},
\quad \lfloor MR'\rfloor=7249403427.
\]

At the claimed terminating \(\varepsilon\), the exact survival margin is

\[
\frac{69899855576037749414028334973789734033}
{2406086951282820104642103179296768000000000000000}>0.
\]

Thus a sufficiently large simple-root component survives.

### [P6] Reconstruction and contract — proved

KTZ revision-1 Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 reconstruct one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial at a seed and propagate it through the connected component without agreement loss.

Finally,

\[
\frac\varepsilon{10}-\frac{174}{p}
=rac{474228300318058776377}
{14745700000000000000000}>0,
\]

and

\[
\varepsilon-\frac{957}{10p}
=rac{490671300318058776377}
{1474570000000000000000}>0.
\]

Also `ceil(εM)=7249403428` and `ceil(εM/10)=724940343`.

## Soundness Ledger

| Stage | Exact loss/output |
|---|---:|
| selector and labeled points | `κ′₄(1−ρ)N` |
| interpolation | `442779·15137+3776` constraints; surplus `1` |

| point/line peeling | `15136M+4414(t−z)−5933551` |
| fixed subtotal | `C′=752643623258519` |
| reconstruction | zero loss |
| recovery | `ε/10`; `724940343` points |

## Counterexample Attempts

The Moore-only floor gives merely `66814719` points. The spectral quadratic changes sign at the next integer: `F(622400212/M)<0`, so this scalar method alone cannot certify a larger floor. The audited `k=4413` endpoint is negative. Concentrated directions, branch switching, and inseparability are covered by the selector, simple-root deletion, and `deg_Z<p`.

## Characteristic Audit

All derivative degrees are below `p`; the discriminant is nominally homogenized; no specialized leading coefficient is inverted; reconstruction divides only by retained nonzero first derivatives. Total degree `87` and uniform affine-line sampling are unchanged.

## Limitations

This is only the fixed bivariate prime-field instance. The spectral floor is sharp only for the displayed scalar inequality, not necessarily for realizable labeled components. The assigned checkpoint outbox was mounted read-only: `apply_patch` rejected both attempted checkpoint files.

## Team Handoff

- **researcher-0007 / builder:** replace only the component and fixed-charge modules by [P2]–[P5].
- **researcher-0009 / red-team:** audit the two-case elimination and three potential guards.
- **researcher-0010 / integrator:** bind exact score `7249403428`, terminating epsilon, and recovery count `724940343` into the certificate.
12:T1509,# Balanced Two-Range Potential at Score 7,249,403,422

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, acceptance at least

\[
\varepsilon=3334045178670124/10^{16}
\]

forces one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial to agree with the point table on at least `724940343` points. The score is `7249403422`, improving the verified record by `100087013`. The new step retunes researcher-0004’s component potential from a `28291`-incidence credit to `6861826`.

## Test and Notation

Let `h=p+1=147458`, `M=p²=21743566849`, `Λ=p(p+1)=21743714306`, and `N=Mh=3206262880419842`. Acceptance is `rho=|E|/N`. Use

\[
D=15136,  q=15049,  k=4414,  E_D=2618012,
\]

three complete directions plus 408 lines of a fourth direction, and 3776 added point labels.

## Prior Results

The verified incumbent is `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0003/response.json`. The selector, interpolation, cleanup, and C4 modules retuned here are from `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0004/response.json`. Reconstruction uses the exact hypotheses of Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 in the [KTZ primary report](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/147/revision/1/download/).

## Theorem

Every point table and degree-at-most-87 affine-line table over `F_147457` accepted with probability at least `epsilon` admit one `Q∈F_147457[X,Y]` of total degree at most 87 satisfying

\[
\Pr[Q=f]\ge\max\{174/147457,\varepsilon/10\},
\]

and in fact agreeing at at least `724940343` points.

## Proof

[P1, proved] The partial-direction miss envelope is strictly log-concave and maximized at pencil degree `49122`. Its coefficient, after the top-3776 point constraints, is

\[
\kappa'_4=1246437422331006215441194309538667/
8421304329489870366247361127538688.
\]

[P2, proved] There are `6702349500` weighted monomials and `6702349499` imposed equations. Minimum weighted degree therefore gives a squarefree, Z-dependent relation of weight at most `15136` with nonzero Z-derivative. Identity extension and projective-discriminant cleanup give the losses `15136(Λ−t)`, `pz` with `z≤2618012`, and `15049(t−z)`.

[P3, proved] Set

\[
a_0=11/334,  \eta_1=527/50000,  \eta_2=13/200000000,
\quad \tau=7249403422/(10M).
\]

For `delta=D/h`, `theta=k/p`, maximizing centered affine mixing over the line density reduces the desired potential bound to `L_eta(a)≥0` and `R_eta(a)≥0`. At `(eta1,a0)`,

\[
L=965080609567916722203/167327978822000848750000000>0,
\]

\[
R=278412523909059/90780007227550000>0.
\]

At `(eta2,tau)`,

\[
L=51762097687883603297254119/
5909863897761863270450000000000000000>0,
\]

\[
R=2755970527215478145853/801565720104960500000000>0.
\]

The corresponding `Q_eta` and `2(delta−eta)−1` are negative in both ranges, so these right-endpoint checks certify the full intervals.

[P4, proved] Every nonempty peeled component contains at least `4415` points. The two range credits are

\[
K_1=\lceil\eta_1h·4415\rceil=6861826,
\quad K_2=\lceil\eta_2Na_0\rceil=6863707.
\]

The empty-core C4 credit is `133070051`. Hence every no-large-component graph receives the uniform credit `K=6861826`.

[P5, proved] The pre-credit fixed charge is `752643629192070`, so

\[
C=752643622330244.
\]

The no-large-component frontier is

\[
R=(C/N+\kappa'_4)/(1+\kappa'_4),
\quad \lfloor MR\rfloor=7249403421.
\]

Thus acceptance at least `7249403422/M` forces a component of density at least `tau`. KTZ lifting and simple-root propagation give one degree-87 polynomial throughout it.

[P6, proved] The terminating epsilon lies less than `1/N` below `7249403422/M`; indeed

\[
N(7249403422/M-\varepsilon)=182237457224949/1250000000000000<1.
\]

The acceptance lattice therefore upgrades `rho≥epsilon` to `rho≥7249403422/M`. Also `ceil(M epsilon)=7249403422`, `epsilon/10>174/p`, and the component contains at least `ceil(7249403422/10)=724940343` points.

## Soundness Ledger

| Stage | Exact loss or credit |
|---|---:|
| selector | `kappa4'(1−rho)N` |

| reconstruction | zero loss |
| recovery | `max(174/p,epsilon/10)`, at least `724940343` points |

## Counterexample Attempts

Upward decimal rounding causes an exact one-score metadata error. Concentrated directions attain the selector envelope but do not violate it. Inseparability is excluded by `deg_Z<p`, and branch switching is removed with derivative-zero incidences.

## Characteristic Audit

All derivative and restriction degrees are below `p`; the discriminant uses no leading-coefficient division; reconstruction divides only by nonzero `B_Z`; total degree remains 87.

## Limitations

The next score needs credit `7025388`, while the same centered-mixing potential endpoint caps this architecture below `7023216`. A stronger incidence inequality or another ledger saving is required. Both requested checkpoint writes were attempted, but the managed read-only sandbox rejected them.

## Team Handoff

Builder 0007 should import the balanced potential module; red-team 0009 should audit its endpoint fractions; integrator 0010 should use the exact terminating trigger, score, and recovery count above.
13:T523c,# A C4-free peeling credit for the fixed three-direction KTZ chain

## Abstract

For the immutable instance `m=2`, `p=147457`, and total degree `d=87`, I prove soundness at

`ε = 7349491214/21743566849 ≈ 0.33800761692132436`.

The new ingredient is an exact C4-free credit in the `(15130,5195)` core peeling stage. A C4-free bipartite graph on `5194` and `15129` vertices has at most `646374` edges, yielding the universal deletion credit

`K4 = 156513678`.

Splicing this into the three-full-direction interpolation chain reduces the earlier score by `924`. Every table accepted with probability at least `ε` admits one bivariate polynomial of total degree at most `87` agreeing with the point table on more than `ε/10` of the plane, hence on at least `734949122` points. The comparison score `7810920777` is improved by `461429563`.

## Test and Notation

Let `F=F_147457`. A point table is `f:F²→F`. Each affine line `L` carries a univariate polynomial `P_L` of degree at most `87`, interpreted using a fixed affine parametrization of `L`. The verifier samples an affine line uniformly and then a point of that line uniformly, accepting when `P_L(x)=f(x)`.

Set

- `h=p+1=147458` lines through each point;
- `M=p²=21743566849` points;
- `Λ=p(p+1)=21743714306` affine lines;
- `N=p²(p+1)=3206262880419842` incidences.

Thus uniform-line-then-point sampling is uniform on the `N` incidences. Let `E` be the accepted incidence graph, `ρ=|E|/N`, and `a_x` the accepted degree of point `x`.

The auxiliary parameters are

`t_dir=3`, `r=3p=442371`, `D=15129`, `q_der=D−87=15042`, `s=5195`, `k=s−1=5194`, `ν_max=173`, and `E_D=2615604`.

The acceptance premise `ρ≥ε` is equivalently

`|E|≥εN=1083741275434012`.

## Prior Results

All active campaign-30 submissions, leaderboards, verifier material, and message-board entries were inspected, excluding every directory named `superseded`. The current campaign history and verified-results files contain no promoted point. The board's score-one discussion predates the current admissibility floor and recovery contract and is therefore not a leaderboard route.

The historical doubly audited comparison threshold is approximately `0.35922904602094702`, with score `7810920777`. The active researcher-0003 note supplied the same three-direction algebraic architecture without a C4 peeling credit, at score `7349492138`. Researcher-0001 and researcher-0002 recorded a related credit only for the old parameters `D=17642`, `k=5494`; it does not certify the present corner.

The only external theorem dependencies are Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 of Kominers–Thaler–Zheng, [official ECCC revision 1](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/147/revision/1/download). The direction estimate, interpolation count, squarefree reduction, discriminant bound, C4 credit, affine mixing calculation, and component inequality are proved here.

## Theorem

**Theorem 1.** For `p=147457`, `d=87`, and `ε=7349491214/21743566849`, every point table `f:F_p²→F_p` and every degree-at-most-87 affine-line table with acceptance probability at least `ε` admit a polynomial `Q∈F_p[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` satisfying

`Pr_x[Q(x)=f(x)] > ε/10 = 3674745607/108717834245`.

Consequently, `Q` agrees with `f` on at least `734949122` points.

**Lemma 2.** For every accepted incidence graph of density `ρ` in `F_147457²`, there are three distinct directions whose union `R` satisfies

`U_R/N ≤ (1610629120/10871857153)(1−ρ)`,

where `U_R` is the number of accepted incidences at points whose accepted pencil contains no line of `R`.

**Lemma 3.** For every integer `n≥0` and every C4-free bipartite graph `G=(X,Y,E_G)` with `|X|=21743566849` and `|Y|=n` that admits an emptying order deleting an `X`-vertex only at current degree at most `15129` and a `Y`-vertex only at current degree at most `5194`,

`|E_G| ≤ 15129|X|+5194|Y|−156513678`.

## Proof or Conditional Proof

### [P1] Field and incidence counts — proved

The factorization `p−1=2^14·3²` is complete. Modulo `p`,

`10^(p−1)=1`, `10^((p−1)/2)=p−1`, and `10^((p−1)/3)=78348`,

while both `gcd(10^((p−1)/2)−1,p)` and `gcd(10^((p−1)/3)−1,p)` equal `1`. Pocklington's criterion proves that `p` is prime. Standard affine-plane counting gives `M`, `Λ`, and `N` as above.

### [P2] Three-direction pencil coverage — proved

Choose a uniformly random three-element subset of the `h` directions and include all `p` lines in those directions. A point of accepted degree `a` is uncovered with probability

`H_a=C(h−a,3)/C(h,3)`.

For `1≤a≤h−3`, the quantity controlling `aH_a/(h−a)` is

`(a/3)C(h−a−1,2)`.

The ratio of consecutive terms is

`((a+1)(h−a−3))/(a(h−a−1))`,

which is at least one exactly when `h−3−3a≥0`. Its maximum is therefore at `j=49152`. Hence

`aH_a ≤ κ(h−a)` for every `0≤a≤h`,

where

`κ = 1610629120/10871857153`.

Averaging gives

`E_R[U_R/N] = (1/(Mh))Σ_x a_xH_(a_x) ≤ κ(1−ρ)`.

Some three-direction family satisfies the asserted inequality. There is no Markov or union-bound loss.

### [P3] Weighted interpolation and squarefree reduction — proved

The number of monomials `X^iY^jZ^z` with `i+j+87z≤D` is

`V_D=Σ_(z=0)^173 C(D−87z+2,2)=6693082347`.

Every selected line graph imposes at most `D+1=15130` homogeneous coefficient constraints. Since

`442371·15130=6693073230<V_D`,

there is a nonzero `(1,1,87)`-weighted-degree-at-most-`D` polynomial `A` satisfying

`A(L(t),P_L(t))≡0`

on all selected lines. A nonzero Z-independent interpolant would have total degree at most `D` and vanish formally on `442371>D` distinct lines, contradicting KTZ Lemma 2.5. Thus `A` depends on `Z`. Since `deg_Z(A)≤173<p`, ordinary differentiation gives `A_Z≠0`.

Choose an eligible `A` of minimum weighted degree. Suppose an irreducible factor `F` occurs with multiplicity `e≥2`, and write `A=F^eG`. Removing one copy preserves all selected formal line identities because `F[t]` is an integral domain. If `deg_Z(F)=0`, nonvanishing of `A_Z=F^eG_Z` implies nonvanishing of `(F^(e−1)G)_Z`. If `deg_Z(F)>0`, then `e≤173<p`, `F_Z≠0`, and `F` does not divide `F_Z`; modulo `F`, the derivative after removal contains the nonzero term `(e−1)F_ZG`. Thus the reduced interpolant still has nonzero Z-derivative, contradicting minimality. Therefore `A` is squarefree.

### [P4] Extension to identity lines — proved

Call a point covered when its accepted pencil meets `R`. Let `T` consist of `R` and every unselected line having more than `D` covered accepted points. At such a point `x` on an added line `L`, a selected accepted line gives `A(x,f(x))=0`, while acceptance on `L` gives `P_L(x)=f(x)`. Thus `A(L(t),P_L(t))` has more than `D` roots and degree at most `D`, so it is identically zero.

Writing `t=|T|` and `E_T` for accepted incidences on `T`, every accepted incidence outside `T` is either at an uncovered point or among at most `D` covered incidences of its line. Therefore

`|E|≤|E_T|+U_R+D(Λ−t)`.

### [P5] Primitive relation and exceptional lines — proved

Write `A=HB`, where `H∈F[X,Y]` is the coefficient content in `Z` and `B` is primitive. Put `h0=deg(H)`, `W=wdeg(B)`, and `ν=deg_Z(B)`. Then `h0+W≤D`, `1≤ν≤173<p`, and `B` is squarefree. Primitivity excludes Z-independent irreducible factors. Every positive-Z-degree irreducible factor has nonzero Z-derivative because its Z-degree is below `p`; hence `gcd(B,B_Z)=1`.

For `ν≥2`, the nominal projective Z-discriminant `Δ_B(X,Y)` is nonzero and has degree at most

`(ν−1)(2W−87ν)`.

If a noncontent identity line also has `B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))≡0`, the homogenized specialization has the repeated finite projective root `[P_L(t):1]`; hence `Δ_B` vanishes formally on that line. This remains valid when the leading Z-coefficient collapses. No leading coefficient is divided by.

The number of content and derivative-degenerate identity lines is at most

`h0+(ν−1)(2W−87ν) ≤ h0+(ν−1)(2(D−h0)−87ν)`.

For `ν≥2` this is maximized at `h0=0`, `ν=173`, giving

`E_D=172(30258−15051)=2615604`.

For `ν=1`, a noncontent derivative-degenerate identity line would divide both coefficients of `B`, contradicting primitivity; the content count is smaller than `E_D`.

On every other identity line, `B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))` is a nonzero polynomial of degree at most

`q_der=D−87=15042`,

so it has at most `15042` roots.

### [P6] Fixed C4 corner — proved

Let a C4-free bipartite graph have `k=5194` left vertices and `D=15129` right vertices. If the right degrees are `r_i`, C4-freeness gives

`Σ_i C(r_i,2)≤C(k,2)=13486221`.

At `Z=646374=42D+10956` edges, convexity minimizes the left side at

`D·C(42,2)+10956·42=13486221`.

One additional edge forces at least

`D·C(42,2)+10957·42=13486263`,

which is impossible. Thus `Z≤646374`, and

`K4=2Dk−Z=156513678`.

### [P7] C4-free peeling credit — proved

First suppose a C4-free graph has part sizes `m≥k` and `n≥D` and admits the stipulated emptying order. Induct on `m+n`. At the boundary `m=k`, apply [P6] to any `D` right vertices and charge at most `k` edges for every remaining right vertex:

`|E_G|≤646374+k(n−D)=Dm+kn−K4`.

The boundary `n=D` is symmetric. In the interior, delete the first vertex of the emptying order and apply induction; the deleted vertex contributes at most `D` or `k`, respectively.

For `n<D`, use `|E_G|≤Mn`. The difference between the claimed bound and `Mn` is

`(D−n)M+kn−K4`,

which is minimized at `n=D−1` and equals

`M+k(D−1)−K4=21665628003>0`.

This proves Lemma 3 for every `n≥0`.

### [P8] Nonempty simple-root core — proved

Let `e≤E_D` be the number of exceptional lines in `T`. Delete all their accepted incidences, delete derivative-zero incidences on the remaining `t−e` lines, and peel points of current degree at most `D` and lines of current degree at most `k`.

If peeling empties the residual graph, [P7] gives

`|E_T|≤pe+q_der(t−e)+DM+k(t−e)−K4`.

Combining this with [P4] yields

`|E|≤U_R+DΛ+DM+(s−88)t+(p−q_der−s+1)e−K4`.

Both variable coefficients are positive:

`s−88=5107`, and `p−q_der−s+1=127221`.

Using `t≤Λ` and `e≤E_D` gives

`|E|≤U_R+C*`,

where

`C*=(q_der+s−1)Λ+DM+(p−q_der−s+1)E_D−K4`

`=440005802696216+328958422858521+332759756484−156513678`

`=769296828797543`.

By [P2], complete deletion at acceptance `ε` would imply

`ε≤C*/N+κ(1−ε)`.

But exactly

`C*/N+κ(1−ε)=9400308072378016503/27810935621062861282`,

and

`ε−C*/N−κ(1−ε)=1249813349/27810935621062861282>0`.

Therefore a nonempty core remains, with point degree at least `15130`, line degree at least `5195`, formal `B`-identities, and `B_Z(x,f(x))≠0` on every retained edge.

For reference, the continuous threshold of this fixed ledger is

`R*=(C*/N+κ)/(1+κ)=1244293905093223/3681259956715522`.

Exact division gives

`R*·M=7349491213+548266597656141/3681259956715522`,

so `7349491214` is the smallest integer score strictly above this fixed survival threshold.

### [P9] Exact affine incidence mixing — proved

For point set `X` of density `a` and line set `S` of density `b`, the affine incidence matrix satisfies `II^T=pI+J`. Centering the two indicator vectors and applying Cauchy–Schwarz therefore gives

`I(X,S)/N ≤ ab+sqrt(a(1−a)b(1−b)/h)`.

This is the sole Cauchy–Schwarz loss.

### [P10] Component mass — proved

For a connected core component with point density `a` and line density `b`, put

`α=15130/147458=445/4337`,

`β=5195/147457`,

`c=α/β=13123673/4506143`, and

`γ²=1/(ch)=1039/446204882`.

Minimum degrees give component edge density at least `αa` and at least `βb`. If `b≤ca`, the mixing upper bound is maximized at `b=ca` whenever `ca<1/2`; if `b≥ca`, divide by `b` and use monotonicity of `(1−b)/b`. Both cases imply

`β≤a+γ sqrt((1−a)(1−ca))`.

Let

`τ=ε/10=3674745607/108717834245`

and `F(a)=(β−a)²−γ²(1−a)(1−ca)`. Exact arithmetic gives

`β−τ=155449968/108717834245>0`,

`1/2−cτ=2668206923709/6644623283510>0`,

`F(τ)=498727149435244/30939665878432433176225>0`,

and

`F'(τ)=−13793284387/4837976433085<0`.

Since `F''=2(1−1/h)>0`, `F'` is negative throughout `[0,τ]`; hence `F(a)≥F(τ)>0` for every `a≤τ`, contradicting the necessary component inequality. Every component has point density strictly greater than `τ`.

### [P11] One-polynomial recovery — proved

Choose a point `b` in a retained component. It lies on at least `D+1` retained lines. Their degree-at-most-87 labels are formal roots of `B`, all take the common value `f(b)`, and `B_Z(b,f(b))≠0`. KTZ Lemma 6.1 produces one polynomial `Q∈F[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` satisfying `B(X,Y,Q)≡0` and agreeing with every retained seed-pencil label.

At a reached accepted point, `Q` and every adjacent line label have the same simple initial value and are degree-at-most-87 roots of the same restricted equation. The one-variable specialization of KTZ Lemma 2.7 makes them identical. Connectivity propagates this same `Q` through the component, so `Q(x)=f(x)` at every component point.

### [P12] Recovery contract and score — proved

Because every component has density greater than `τ`, the recovered polynomial agrees at more than `τM=A/10=734949121.4` points and therefore at least `734949122` points.

The acceptance parameter is admissible because

`ε−957/(10p)=73353795791/217435668490>0`.

Moreover,

`τ−174/p=3546458017/108717834245>0`.

Thus the required recovery fraction is

`max(174/147457,ε/10)=ε/10`,

and the guaranteed count `734949122` exceeds the absolute floor

`174p=25657518`.

Finally, `ceil(εp²)=7349491214`. The comparison threshold has score `7810920777`, so the improvement is `461429563`. This proves Theorem 1.

## Counterexample Attempts

1. For `f=0`, labeling exactly `49152` complete directions by zero and all other lines by one attains equality in the pointwise pencil-energy envelope. It does not refute the theorem because choosing one accepted direction covers all points.

2. Labeling `49842` complete directions by zero gives acceptance above `ε`, with exact cross-product margin `1583453846`. The accepted directions are maximally concentrated, but `Q=0` explains every point.

3. Let `g(X)=∏_(a=0)^15041(X−a)` and `B=Z(Z+g(X))`. At the zero root, derivative cleanup encounters exactly `15042Λ=327068950590852` degenerate incidences. This shows the whole-B derivative interface is sharp, although the factor `Z` itself already identifies `Q=0`.

4. The inseparable squarefree polynomial `Z^p−X` has `B_Z=0`, but weighted degree `87p=12828759>D`; the interpolation cutoff excludes it.

5. Relations such as `Z²−X²` permit branch changes only at derivative-zero points, confirming that simple-root deletion is load-bearing.

6. With the new credit but `s=5194`, the candidate score would be `7349362799`; however, the exact component endpoint is `−4708014974534477/4207794559466810911966600`. This refutes only that parameter within the present centered-mixing certificate.

## Characteristic Audit

- The Pocklington certificate in [P1] proves primality.
- `87<15129<147457`, `173<147457`, and `15042<147457`.
- The squarefree reduction explicitly handles derivative coefficients and repeated Z-independent factors.
- Primitivity, squarefreeness, and the Z-degree cutoff jointly prove `gcd(B,B_Z)=1`.
- The discriminant is nominal and projective; leading-coefficient collapse causes no division.
- Formal root identities, not equality merely as functions on `F_p`, are used throughout.
- Lifting divides only by certified nonzero simple-root derivatives.
- Every finite comparison is an integer or rational identity replayed by the checker.

## Limitations

The theorem is only for the fixed bivariate prime-field instance and total degree `87`. It makes no claim about higher dimensions, extension fields, individual-degree testing, or alternate sampling.

The value `646374` is a proved convex C4 upper bound, not a proved affine-geometric extremal value. A smaller true corner maximum would increase the credit. The direction-energy coefficient is sharp for the point-degree envelope, while label-sensitive selection may improve it.

No global optimality is claimed for `(t_dir,D,s)=(3,15129,5195)`. The neighboring `s=5194` remains blocked by the component inequality, and the derivative construction shows that a better cleanup must exploit factor structure. The current campaign history has no audit yet; this submission still requires two independent matching verifications.

## Team Handoff

- **Combinatorial-core and peeling modules:** import Lemma 3 with `(D,k,Z,K4)=(15129,5194,646374,156513678)` and retain the `n<D` endpoint check.
- **Interpolation and identity-extension modules:** import `(t_dir,r,D,V_D−r(D+1))=(3,442371,15129,9117)` together with [P3]–[P5].
- **Survival optimizer:** replace the no-credit fixed charge by `C*=769296828797543`; the continuous threshold is `1244293905093223/3681259956715522`.
- **Component and recovery modules:** use `s=5195`, `F(τ)=498727149435244/30939665878432433176225`, and KTZ Lemmas 2.7 and 6.1.
- **Certification modules and both auditors:** replay the exact certificate and audit [P6]–[P8] first; those are the only new load-bearing interfaces relative to the three-direction chain.

## Abstract

For the affine line-versus-point test on `F_147457^2`, I prove the admissible soundness threshold

`epsilon = 7349491214/21743566849 = 0.33800761692132436...`.

Acceptance at least `epsilon` forces one bivariate polynomial of total degree at most `87` to agree with the point table on more than `epsilon/10` of the plane, hence on at least `734949122` points.

The new fixed-instance ingredient is an exact affine-incidence credit in the final two-sided peel. A `C4`-free residual with `5194` point vertices and `15129` line vertices has at most `646374` edges. Consequently an empty `(15130,5195)` core costs `156513678` fewer incidences than separate point and line charging. Spliced into a three-complete-direction pencil argument, this lowers the previous unaudited three-direction count by `924` and the stated comparison count by `461429563`.

## Test and Notation

Let `F=F_147457`, `d=87`, and

- `h=p+1=147458`;
- `M=p^2=21743566849` points;
- `Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306` affine lines;
- `N=p^2(p+1)=3206262880419842` incident point-line pairs.

The verifier samples a uniform affine line and then a uniform point on it. Since every line has `p` points, this is uniform sampling from the `N` incidences.

For the accepted incidence graph `G`, write `rho=|E(G)|/N`. The auxiliary parameters are

| parameter | value |
|---|---:|
| selected directions | `t=3` |
| selected lines | `r=3p=442371` |
| weighted degree | `D=15129` |
| point-core degree | `D+1=15130` |
| line-core degree | `s=5195` |
| line-deletion cap | `b=s-1=5194` |
| derivative root cap | `q=D-d=15042` |
| maximum Z-degree | `nu<=173` |
| exceptional-line cap | `E_D=2615604` |
| pencil-envelope maximizer | `j=49152` |
| pencil coefficient | `K=1610629120/10871857153` |
| residual edge cap | `Z_*=646374` |
| C4 peeling credit | `kappa=156513678` |
| fixed charge after credit | `C_*=769296828797543` |

The theorem uses

`epsilon=7349491214/M`

and its acceptance premise is equivalently at least

`epsilon*N=1083741275434012`

accepted incidences.

## Prior Results

The authoritative campaign-30 soundness history contains no verified point. The comparison threshold supplied for this task is the terminating decimal `0.35922904602094702`, whose absolute count is `7810920777`.

The prior campaign-30 submission by researcher-0003 derived the three-direction tuple `(D,s)=(15129,5195)` and count `7349492138`, but did not use a `C4` credit. Researcher-0002 proved the same style of residual-corner lemma at the different tuple `(17642,5494)`. Neither campaign-30 artifact has an audit verdict. The present proof recomputes the residual corner at the new tuple and includes every other load-bearing step explicitly.

The historical campaign-10 theorem at `0.359229046020947` was independently accepted twice. Its proof is comparison material only. No theorem from that campaign is imported here.

There is no load-bearing literature dependency. The interpolation, primitive cleanup, component estimate, and simple-root reconstruction are proved directly. In particular, the analogous KTZ revision-1 Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 are not invoked.

## Theorem

### Theorem 1

For `p=147457`, `d=87`, every function `f:F_p^2 -> F_p`, and every assignment of a degree-at-most-87 polynomial to every affine line, if

`Pass(f,P) >= 7349491214/21743566849`,

then there is a polynomial `Q in F_p[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` satisfying

`Pr_x[Q(x)=f(x)] >= max(174/147457, 3674745607/108717834245)`.

Moreover, `Q` agrees with `f` on at least `734949122` points.

### Lemma 2

For every accepted incidence graph of density `rho` on `F_147457^2`, there are three distinct directions whose `442371` lines form a set `R` such that

`U_R/N <= (1610629120/10871857153)(1-rho)`,

where `U_R` counts accepted incidences at points whose accepted pencil contains no line of `R`.

### Lemma 3

Every `C4`-free bipartite graph with vertex-class sizes `5194` and `15129` has at most `646374` edges.

### Lemma 4

For every integer `n>=0`, every `C4`-free bipartite graph with `21743566849` point-side vertices and `n` line-side vertices that is emptied by deletion of point vertices of current degree at most `15129` and line vertices of current degree at most `5194` has at most

`15129*21743566849 + 5194*n - 156513678`

edges.

## Proof

### [P1] Fixed field and incidence arithmetic — proved

The affine plane has `M=p^2` points, `Lambda=p(p+1)` lines, and `N=p^2(p+1)` incidences.

For primality, `p-1=2^14*3^2`. Direct modular exponentiation gives

`10^(p-1)=1`, `10^((p-1)/2)=p-1`, and `10^((p-1)/3)=78348 mod p`,

with

`gcd(p-2,p)=gcd(78347,p)=1`.

Pocklington's criterion therefore certifies that `147457` is prime.

### [P2] Three-direction pencil coverage — proved

Choose a uniform three-element subset of the `h` directions and include every line in those directions. A point having accepted degree `a` is missed with probability

`H_a=binom(h-a,3)/binom(h,3)`.

For `0<a<h-2`, the quantity relevant to the affine majorant is

`a H_a/(h-a)=a(h-a-1)(h-a-2)/(h(h-1)(h-2))`.

The ratio of consecutive positive numerators is

`((a+1)(h-a-3))/(a(h-a-1))`.

It is at least one exactly when `h-3-3a>=0`. Thus the unique maximum is attained at `j=49152`, and

`a H_a <= K(h-a)`

for every integer `0<=a<=h`, where

`K=j*binom(h-j,3)/((h-j)binom(h,3))=1610629120/10871857153`.

Since `sum_x a_x=rho*M*h`, averaging gives

`E_R[U_R]/N <= K(1-rho)`.

At least one three-direction set realizes this bound, proving Lemma 2. This is averaging only; there is no Markov or union-bound loss.

### [P3] Weighted interpolation — proved

Give `X,Y,Z` weights `(1,1,87)` and put `D=15129`. The number of monomials of weighted degree at most `D` is

`V_D=sum_{z=0}^{173} binom(D-87z+2,2)=6693082347`.

Every selected labeled-line identity imposes at most `D+1=15130` homogeneous coefficient equations, while

`442371*15130=6693073230<V_D`.

Hence there is a nonzero polynomial `A(X,Y,Z)` of weighted degree at most `D` vanishing formally on every selected line graph.

A `Z`-independent solution would be a bivariate polynomial of degree at most `D` divisible by the distinct equations of `442371>D` affine lines, which is impossible. Thus `A` depends on `Z`. Since `deg_Z(A)<=173<p`, one has `A_Z!=0`.

Choose a nonzero interpolant of minimum weighted degree. If an irreducible factor occurred twice, dividing by one copy would preserve every selected formal identity: specialization occurs in the domain `F[t]`, so either that factor or the complementary factor specializes to zero. The quotient would be a lower-weight nonzero interpolant, a contradiction. Therefore `A` is squarefree.

### [P4] Extension to identity lines — proved

Call an accepted point covered when its accepted pencil meets the selected line set `R`. Let `T` consist of `R` and every other line having more than `D` covered accepted points. At a covered accepted point of a line `L`, a selected accepted line through that point shows

`A(x,P_L(x))=A(x,f(x))=0`.

The restriction `A(L(t),P_L(t))` has degree at most `D`, so more than `D` roots force a formal identity. Consequently every line in `T` is an `A`-identity line.

Writing `t=|T|` and `E_T` for accepted edges on these lines gives

`|E| <= |E_T|+U_R+D(Lambda-t)`.

### [P5] Primitive and derivative cleanup — proved

Write `A=CB`, where `C in F[X,Y]` is the coefficient content in `Z` and `B` is primitive. Let `c_0=deg C`, `W=wdeg(B)`, and `nu=deg_Z(B)`. Weighted leading forms do not cancel, so

`c_0+W=wdeg(A)<=D`.

The polynomial `B` is squarefree and `1<=nu<=173<p`. Primitivity excludes `Z`-independent irreducible factors. Every irreducible factor therefore has nonzero `Z`-derivative, and squarefreeness gives `gcd(B,B_Z)=1`.

For `nu>=2`, the nominal-degree discriminant is nonzero. Its monomials have coefficient degree `2nu-2` and coefficient-index weight `nu(nu-1)`, hence its `(X,Y)`-degree is at most

`(nu-1)(2W-87nu)`.

If a noncontent identity line also makes `B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))` vanish formally, the homogenized nominal-degree binary form has a singular finite root. Euler's identity is valid because `nu<p`; therefore the specialized nominal discriminant vanishes. No leading coefficient is inverted.

The number of content or derivative-degenerate identity lines is at most

`c_0+(nu-1)(2W-87nu) <= (nu-1)(2D-87nu)`.

The last expression increases through `nu=173`, because its consecutive difference is `2(D-87nu)>0` for `nu<=172`. Its maximum is

`172*(2*15129-87*173)=2615604`.

For `nu=1`, a derivative-degenerate noncontent identity line would divide both coefficients of the primitive linear polynomial, which is impossible; its content count is at most `D-87<2615604`.

On every remaining identity line, `B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))` is a nonzero polynomial of degree at most

`q=D-87=15042`,

and therefore has at most `15042` roots.

### [P6] The residual affine-incidence corner — proved

Consider a `C4`-free bipartite graph with `b=5194` point vertices and `D=15129` line vertices. If the line degrees are `r_1,...,r_D`, every pair of point vertices has at most one common line, so

`sum_i binom(r_i,2) <= binom(5194,2)=13486221`.

For a fixed edge total, discrete convexity minimizes the left side when the degrees differ by at most one. The exact division is

`646374=42*15129+10956`,

and

`15129*binom(42,2)+10956*42=13486221`.

One more edge would make the convex lower bound `13486221+42`. Thus there are at most `646374` edges, proving Lemma 3.

### [P7] C4-free empty-core credit — proved

Let `H` satisfy Lemma 4. For `n>=D`, follow an emptying order until either only `b` point vertices or only `D` line vertices remain. If the point side reaches `b` first, all remaining line vertices have degree at most `b`, so delete down to `D` line vertices. The symmetric argument applies if the line side reaches `D` first. Pad the residual with isolated vertices when necessary.

Edges deleted before the residual cost at most

`D(M-b)+b(n-D)`.

Lemma 3 bounds the residual by `646374`. Therefore

`|E(H)| <= DM+bn-kappa`,

where

`kappa=2Db-646374=156513678`.

For `n<D`, the trivial estimate `|E(H)|<=Mn` suffices because the minimum difference occurs at `n=D-1` and equals

`M+b(D-1)-kappa=21665628003>0`.

This proves Lemma 4 for every `n>=0`.

### [P8] Cleanup, peeling, and survival — proved

Delete all accepted edges on the `e` exceptional identity lines and at most `q` derivative-zero edges on each remaining identity line. Apply Lemma 4 to the resulting graph with `n=t-e`.

If the `(15130,5195)` core were empty, P4-P7 would give

`|E| <= U_R+D(Lambda-t)+pe+q(t-e)+DM+b(t-e)-kappa`.

The coefficients of `t` and `e` after collection are

`q+b-D=s-88=5107>0`

and

`p-q-b=p-q-s+1=127221>0`.

Using `t<=Lambda` and `e<=E_D` yields

`|E| <= U_R+C_*`,

where

`C_*=(q+s-1)Lambda+DM+(p-q-s+1)E_D-kappa`

`=440005802696216+328958422858521+332759756484-156513678`

`=769296828797543`.

Combining this with P2 gives, under complete deletion,

`rho <= R_0 := (C_*/N+K)/(1+K)`

with

`R_0=1244293905093223/3681259956715522`.

Exact cross multiplication gives

`7349491213/M <= R_0 < 7349491214/M`.

At `epsilon=7349491214/M`, the survival margin in the original inequality is

`epsilon-C_*/N-K(1-epsilon)`

`=1249813349/27810935621062861282>0`.

Thus acceptance at least `epsilon` leaves a nonempty core with point degree at least `15130`, line degree at least `5195`, formal `B`-identities, and `B_Z(x,f(x))!=0` on every retained edge.

### [P9] Exact component mass — proved

For point set `X`, put `a=|X|/M` and let `m_L=|X intersection L|`. Ordered-pair counting gives

`sum_L m_L=h|X|`

and

`sum_L m_L^2=|X|^2+p|X|`.

Therefore

`sum_L (m_L-ap)^2=p^3a(1-a)`.

For a line set of density `ell`, centering its indicator and applying Cauchy-Schwarz yields

`I(X,S)/N <= a ell + sqrt(a(1-a)ell(1-ell)/h)`.

Consider a connected core component. Define

`alpha=15130/147458=445/4337`,

`beta=5195/147457`,

`c=alpha/beta=13123673/4506143`,

`gamma^2=1/(ch)=1039/446204882`.

Minimum degrees imply retained-edge density at least `alpha*a` and at least `beta*ell`. Splitting at `ell=ca` and using that `ca<1/2` gives the necessary condition

`beta <= a+gamma*sqrt((1-a)(1-ca))`.

Let

`tau=epsilon/10=3674745607/108717834245`

and

`F(a)=(beta-a)^2-gamma^2(1-a)(1-ca)`.

The exact endpoint values are

`beta-tau=155449968/108717834245>0`,

`1/2-c*tau=2668206923709/6644623283510>0`,

`F(tau)=498727149435244/30939665878432433176225>0`,

`F'(tau)=-13793284387/4837976433085<0`.

Moreover `F''=2(1-1/h)>0`, so `F'` is negative throughout `[0,tau]` and `F(a)>=F(tau)>0` there. This contradicts the necessary component condition. Every component therefore has point density greater than `tau`.

Since `tau*M=734949121.4`, every component contains at least `734949122` point vertices.

### [P10] One-polynomial reconstruction — proved

Choose a point `x_0` in a retained component and translate it to the origin. Put `a_0=f(x_0)` and `c_1=B_Z(0,0,a_0)!=0`.

Recursively construct homogeneous polynomials `Q_1,...,Q_87`. If `a_0+Q_1+...+Q_{n-1}` solves `B=0` modulo `(X,Y)^n`, adding a homogeneous polynomial `Q_n` changes the degree-`n` residual by `c_1 Q_n`. Division by `c_1` uniquely cancels that residual. Let

`Q=a_0+Q_1+...+Q_87`.

Each of the at least `D+1` retained line labels through `x_0` is a formal root with the same simple constant value. The one-variable version of the recursion shows that its coefficients through degree `87` equal those of `Q` restricted to the line. Both polynomials have degree at most `87`, so they are identical.

The polynomial `B(X,Y,Q(X,Y))` has total degree at most the weighted degree `D`. It vanishes formally on `D+1` distinct seed lines, whose distinct linear equations divide it. Hence it is zero identically.

At an accepted simple intersection of a recovered line with a new retained line, `Q` and the new line label are two formal roots with the same constant value. The same recursion makes them identical. Connectivity propagates the fixed polynomial `Q` throughout the component. It agrees with `f` at every component point.

### [P11] Soundness contract and score — proved

The admissibility-floor difference is

`epsilon-957/1474570=73353795791/217435668490>0`.

The two recovery fractions satisfy

`epsilon/10-174/147457=3546458017/108717834245>0`.

Thus the required maximum is exactly

`max(2d/p,epsilon/10)=epsilon/10=3674745607/108717834245`.

P9-P10 give at least `734949122` agreements, whose density is

`734949122/21743566849 > epsilon/10`.

Finally,

`ceil(epsilon*p^2)=7349491214`.

The comparison decimal has score `7810920777`, so the exact improvement is `461429563`. This proves Theorem 1.

## Counterexample Attempts

1. A table supported on `49152` complete accepted directions attains the pointwise pencil envelope. It does not refute soundness because the constant polynomial already explains the table, but it shows that a better pencil loss must exploit correlations or polynomial labels rather than only point degrees.

2. Without `C4`-freeness, the complete residual bipartite graph invalidates Lemma 3 and the credit in Lemma 4.

3. A table supported on exactly `15129` accepted directions has accepted degree exactly `15129` everywhere, attaining the generic point-peeling charge.

4. The primitive relation `Z(Z+g(X))` with `deg g=15042` attains `15042` derivative roots on every nonvertical line under the zero branch. Factor-aware recovery is needed to improve this interface.

5. `Z^p-X` and `Z^2-X^2` respectively test inseparability and branch switching. They are excluded by `deg_Z(B)<p` and pointwise nonvanishing of `B_Z`.

## Characteristic Audit

- `147457` is prime by the Pocklington certificate in P1.
- `87<15129<147457` and `deg_Z(B)<=173<147457`.
- Ordinary derivatives detect all positive Z-degrees occurring in `B`.
- Nominal homogenization prevents specialized leading-coefficient division.
- Euler's identity divides only by `nu`, which is nonzero in the field.
- Root counting is applied only to explicitly nonzero univariate polynomials.
- Formal reconstruction divides only by a retained nonzero scalar `B_Z(x,f(x))`.
- No discriminant value, irreducibility claim, floating-point comparison, or randomized experiment is assumed.

## Limitations

The `646374` residual corner is an exact certified upper bound, not a construction or a claimed extremal value. A stronger affine-geometric rich-line estimate could increase the credit further.

The three-direction pointwise envelope is sharp only for the degree-only averaging method. A selector exploiting direction correlations or the line labels may improve it.

The proof is specific to the bivariate prime-field instance and total degree `87`. It makes no claim about dimension lifting, extension fields, or individual degree.

The campaign-30 history still contains no verified point. Leaderboard promotion therefore requires two independent auditors to accept this exact theorem chain and theorem digest.

## Team Handoff

- **Combinatorial core:** import Lemmas 3-4 with `(b,D,Z_*,kappa)=(5194,15129,646374,156513678)`. Preserve the `n<D` case.
- **Integration and optimization:** use `A=7349491214`, `C_*=769296828797543`, and the exact survival margin.
- **Energy and direction selection:** any improvement to `K` must use more than the point-degree envelope.
- **Interpolation and algebra:** retain `(t,r,D,q,nu,E_D)=(3,442371,15129,15042,173,2615604)`.
- **Reconstruction:** P10 is self-contained and imports no external lifting lemma.
- **Certification:** replay the exact checker and request two hash-matched audits.
15:T1d05,# Label-Sensitive Surplus Interpolation Lowers the Fixed Score by 779

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, the verified incumbent selects three complete directions and leaves an interpolation kernel of dimension at least `9117`. I spend `9116` of these dimensions on the actual labels of the heaviest points not covered by the selected directions. This reduces the uncovered-incidence coefficient from

\[
\kappa=\frac{1610629120}{10871857153}
\]

to

\[
\kappa'=\left(1-\frac{9116}{21743566849}\right)\kappa
=\frac{35020807257170984960}{236392952779034320897}.
\]

The resulting terminating trigger is

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{3380075810946357}{10^{16}},
\]

with score `7349490435`, improving the incumbent `7349491214` by `779`.

## Test and Notation

Set

\[
h=p+1=147458,\quad M=p^2=21743566849,
\]
\[
\Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306,\quad N=Mh=3206262880419842.
\]

Let `E` be the accepted incidence graph, `rho=|E|/N`, and `a_x` the accepted degree of point `x`.

## Prior Results

The imported record is the doubly verified campaign-30 theorem in `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0003/response.json`, theorem SHA-256 `53c9e438528bd0576c18932996e7607f719d4f9e051243f15e86889aae6b4762`. Its exact audits are in `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/reviews/researcher-0003/verifier-a-researcher-0003/audit.json` and the verified-results ledger. Its interpolation count is

\[
6693082347-442371\cdot15130=9117.
\]

The sensitivity and partial-direction obstruction are recorded in `research_state/campaign-30-leaderboard/submissions/researcher-0001/response.json`. The present proof uses the self-contained version of the incumbent modules, so it has no load-bearing primary-paper dependency.

## Theorem

Let `p=147457`, `d=87`, and `epsilon=3380075810946357/10^16`. Every point table and every affine-line table of univariate degree at most `87` with acceptance at least `epsilon` admit a polynomial in `F_p[X,Y]` of total degree at most `87` agreeing with the point table on more than `epsilon/10` of `F_p²`.

## Proof

[P1, proved] The verified three-direction averaging lemma supplies three directions whose `3p=442371` lines leave uncovered accepted-incidence mass

\[
U\le \kappa(1-\rho)N.
\]

[P2, proved] Choose the `k=9116` largest weights `a_x` among uncovered points, or every uncovered point if there are fewer. For nonnegative weights totaling `U` on at most `M` points, their top `k` values total at least `kU/M`. After declaring these points covered, the residual mass satisfies

\[
U'\le\left(1-\frac{k}{M}\right)U
\le\kappa'(1-\rho)N.
\]

[P3, proved] Impose the original formal identities on the `442371` selected labeled lines and additionally impose `A(x,f(x))=0` at the selected points. Weighted degree `D=15129` gives `6693082347` monomials. The line identities impose at most `6693073230` equations and the point labels impose at most `9116`, leaving dimension at least one.

Every nonzero solution is Z-dependent. Choose one of minimum weighted degree. Dividing out one copy of a repeated irreducible factor preserves every formal line identity and every added point zero. The incumbent repeated-factor argument also preserves a nonzero Z-derivative. Minimality therefore gives a squarefree `A` with `A_Z` nonzero and `deg_Z A≤173<p`.

[P4, proved] Redefine a covered point to mean either a point hit by an accepted selected-direction line or one of the additional labeled points. At every covered point, `A(x,f(x))=0`. Hence any unselected line containing more than `D` covered accepted points is an A-identity line. The identity-extension inequality becomes

\[
|E|\le |E_T|+U'+D(\Lambda-|T|).
\]

[P5, proved] The verified primitive cleanup, nominal-discriminant estimate, and C4-free peeling apply unchanged. Their parameters are

\[
q=D-d=15042,\quad E_D=2615604,
\]

line threshold `s=5195`, and peeling credit `156513678`. Complete deletion would imply

\[
\rho\le \frac{C_*}{N}+\kappa'(1-\rho),
\qquad C_*=769296828797543.
\]

[P6, proved] The strict frontier is

\[
R'=\frac{C_*/N+\kappa'}{1+\kappa'}
=\frac{61159938999447089357}{180942506690803537238}.
\]

At the claimed terminating epsilon,

\[
\varepsilon-\frac{C_*}{N}-\kappa'(1-\varepsilon)
=\frac{64670249872480163804912949}
{2363929527790343208970000000000000000}>0.
\]

Thus a nonempty `(15130,5195)` simple-root core survives.

[P7, proved] The incumbent affine-incidence component argument applies with `tau=epsilon/10`. Its endpoint polynomial satisfies `F(tau)>0`, `F'(tau)<0`, and `F''=2(1-1/h)>0`; hence every connected core component contains more than `tau M` points. The incumbent formal implicit-lifting and propagation argument then produces one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial agreeing throughout that component.

Finally,

\[
\frac{\varepsilon}{10}-\frac{174}{147457}
=\frac{481015838854716964149}{14745700000000000000000}>0.
\]

Therefore the required maximum is `epsilon/10=3380075810946357/10^17`, and

\[
\left\lceil\varepsilon M\right\rceil=7349490435,
\qquad
\left\lceil\frac{\varepsilon M}{10}\right\rceil=734949044.
\]

This proves the theorem.

## Counterexample Attempts

Three noncollinear point pencils use the same `3p` line budget but give coefficient approximately `0.148148148093641`, worse than the incumbent. A two-direction/one-pencil/one-line hybrid gives approximately `0.148147310890715`, also worse. These exact negative results rule out the most economical pencil replacements.

## Characteristic Audit

All Z-degrees are at most `173<p`. Added point constraints introduce no derivative, discriminant, irreducibility, or interpolation-multiplicity issue. Repeated-factor removal preserves both line identities and point zeros. The inherited cleanup never divides by a specialized leading coefficient, and reconstruction divides only by a certified nonzero simple-root derivative.

## Limitations

The improvement uses only the guaranteed rank-nullity surplus. It does not prove an additional rank deficit, optimize multiplicity constraints, or improve the C4 corner. The campaign-10-frugal history file is presently empty; comparison is against the imported doubly verified campaign-30 record specified by the task.

## Team Handoff

- `researcher-0008`: import [P2]–[P4] as the label-sensitive coverage module.
- `researcher-0009`: audit squarefree reduction with the added point-zero invariant.
- `researcher-0010`: integrate `kappa'`, `R'`, the terminating epsilon, score `7349490435`, and recovery count `734949044`.
- Interpolation/rank module: seek a certified rank deficit beyond the current guaranteed surplus `9117`.
- Verifier: replay the incumbent checker after replacing `kappa` by `kappa'` and adding the single identity `6693082347−6693073230−9116=1`.
16:T1faa,# Spectral Component Floor Lowers the Fixed Score to 7,249,403,428

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, I strengthen the component-potential module of researcher-0004. Combining both residual minimum degrees with the exact centered affine-incidence inequality forces every nonempty residual component to contain at least `622400212` points. This raises the nonempty-component peeling credit from `28291` to `5933551`.

Spliced into the independently audited partial-fourth-direction proof, this gives

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{16}},\qquad
\left\lceil\varepsilon p^2\right\rceil=7249403428.
\]

The recovered polynomial agrees on at least `724940343` points. The score improves the verified `7349490435` record by `100087007` and researcher-0004’s pending score by `35`.

## Test and Notation

Let

\[
h=p+1=147458,\quad M=p^2=21743566849,
\]
\[
\Lambda=p(p+1)=21743714306,\quad N=Mh=3206262880419842.
\]

The accepted-edge density is the prescribed test acceptance. Retain researcher-0004’s parameters

\[
D=15136,\quad k=4414,\quad q=D-d=15049,

\]

## Prior Results

I scanned the 21 active submission notes, all active leaderboard files, 20 verifier audits, and both message boards, excluding every `superseded` directory. The authoritative history remains `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/leaderboards/soundness-history.json`.

The unchanged modules are researcher-0004 `[P2]`–`[P5]` and `[P9]` in `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0004/response.json`. Its audit at `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/reviews/researcher-0004/verifier-a-researcher-0004/audit.json` independently marks every load-bearing module valid; its aggregate `revise` verdict is caused by stale, non-load-bearing comparison metadata. The present theorem corrects that metadata and replaces its component step.

## Theorem

For every point table \(f:\mathbb F_{147457}^2\to\mathbb F_{147457}\) and every assignment of a degree-at-most-87 polynomial to every affine line, if

\[
\operatorname{Pass}(f,P)\ge
\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{16}},
\]

then some \(Q\in\mathbb F_{147457}[X,Y]\) of total degree at most `87` satisfies

\[
\Pr_x[Q(x)=f(x)]\ge
\max\left\{\frac{174}{147457},
\frac{3334045181429561}{10^{17}}\right\}
=rac{3334045181429561}{10^{17}}.
\]

## Proof

### [P1] Centered affine incidence bound — proved

For point and line sets of densities \(a,b\), ordered-pair counting gives

\[
\frac{I(X,S)}N\le ab+
\sqrt{\frac{a(1-a)b(1-b)}h}. \tag{1}
\]

### [P2] Spectral component floor — proved

Let a nonempty residual component have normalized edge mass \(J\), point density \(a\), and line density \(b\). Minimum degrees `(15137,4415)` give

\[
J\ge\alpha a,\quad J\ge\beta b,
\quad \alpha=\frac{15137}{147458},\quad
\beta=\frac{4415}{147457}.
\]

Put \(c=\alpha/\beta=2232056609/651027070\) and
\(\gamma^2=1/(ch)=4415/2232056609\). Applying (1) separately when \(b\le ca\) and \(b\ge ca\) yields, whenever \(ca<1/2\),

\[
\beta\le a+\gamma\sqrt{(1-a)(1-ca)}. \tag{2}
\]

Let \(a_*=622400211/M\) and

\[
F(a)=(\beta-a)^2-\gamma^2(1-a)(1-ca).
\]

Exact checks give

\[
F(a_*)=rac{84092949843}{3578280126216242515417889}>0,
\]

\[
F'(a_*)=-\frac{863766445687}{329134603449922}<0,
\]

\[
\beta-a_*=\frac{28622444}{21743566849}>0,
\quad
\frac12-ca_*=rac{19288988668294}{47999249330495}>0.
\]

Since \(F''=147457/73729>0\), `F` is decreasing throughout `[0,a*]`. Squaring (2) would require `F(a)≤0`, a contradiction. Thus every component has at least `622400212` points.

### [P3] Improved component potential — proved

Set

\[
\eta=\frac{40407}{625000000000},\quad
\delta=\frac D h,\quad \theta=\frac k p,
\]

and conservatively use \(\bar\tau=7249403428/(10M)\), which exceeds the theorem’s recovery density. Maximizing (1) minus \(D|X|+k|S|\) over the line density reduces the desired inequality to one squaring. With \(\delta'=\delta-\eta\), its guards are

\[
Q=4\delta'(\delta'-1)+1/h
=-\frac{195584747102179735885422401703791}
{530856000097656250000000000000000}<0,
\]

\[
L(\bar\tau)=
\frac{97794057801029066737011121001113}
{28856757313290348000244140625000000000000000}>0,
\]

\[
R(\bar\tau)=
\frac{4306203950438485321228529}
{1252446437664000781250000000}>0.
\]

Because `Q<0` and `2δ'−1<0`, these endpoint checks prove throughout the relevant interval

\[
I(X,S)\le D|X|+k|S|-\eta h|X|. \tag{3}
\]

By [P2], every nonempty component therefore contributes integer credit at least

\[
\left\lceil\eta h\cdot622400212\right\rceil=5933551.
\]

### [P4] Peeling dichotomy — proved

Sequentially peel points of degree at most `D` and lines of degree at most `k`. If a residual component remains and none reaches the recovery density, (3) supplies credit `5933551`. If the core empties, the audited `C4`-free corner supplies the larger credit `133070051`. Hence

\[
|E(G)|\le15136M+4414(t-z)-5933551. \tag{4}
\]

### [P5] Survival — proved

The audited selector, interpolation, identity-extension, and cleanup inequalities combine with (4). Since the coefficients of `t` and `z` are `4327` and `127994`, respectively,

\[
C'=423197911537678+329110627826464
+335089827928-5933551
=752643623258519.
\]

Absence of a large component would imply

\[
\rho\le C'/N+\kappa'_4(1-\rho).
\]

Its frontier is

\[
R'=rac{3223268780051728141186708743365483}
{9667741751820876581688555437077355},
\quad \lfloor MR'\rfloor=7249403427.
\]

At the claimed terminating \(\varepsilon\), the exact survival margin is

\[
\frac{69899855576037749414028334973789734033}
{2406086951282820104642103179296768000000000000000}>0.
\]

Thus a sufficiently large simple-root component survives.

### [P6] Reconstruction and contract — proved

KTZ revision-1 Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 reconstruct one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial at a seed and propagate it through the connected component without agreement loss.

Finally,

\[
\frac\varepsilon{10}-\frac{174}{p}
=rac{474228300318058776377}
{14745700000000000000000}>0,
\]

and

\[
\varepsilon-\frac{957}{10p}
=rac{490671300318058776377}
{1474570000000000000000}>0.
\]

Also `ceil(εM)=7249403428` and `ceil(εM/10)=724940343`.

## Soundness Ledger

| Stage | Exact loss/output |

| fixed subtotal | `C′=752643623258519` |
| reconstruction | zero loss |
| recovery | `ε/10`; `724940343` points |

## Counterexample Attempts

The Moore-only floor gives merely `66814719` points. The spectral quadratic changes sign at the next integer: `F(622400212/M)<0`, so this scalar method alone cannot certify a larger floor. The audited `k=4413` endpoint is negative. Concentrated directions, branch switching, and inseparability are covered by the selector, simple-root deletion, and `deg_Z<p`.

## Characteristic Audit

All derivative degrees are below `p`; the discriminant is nominally homogenized; no specialized leading coefficient is inverted; reconstruction divides only by retained nonzero first derivatives. Total degree `87` and uniform affine-line sampling are unchanged.

## Limitations

This is only the fixed bivariate prime-field instance. The spectral floor is sharp only for the displayed scalar inequality, not necessarily for realizable labeled components. The assigned checkpoint outbox was mounted read-only: `apply_patch` rejected both attempted checkpoint files.

## Team Handoff

- **researcher-0007 / builder:** replace only the component and fixed-charge modules by [P2]–[P5].
- **researcher-0009 / red-team:** audit the two-case elimination and three potential guards.

17:T1509,# Balanced Two-Range Potential at Score 7,249,403,422

## Abstract

For `p=147457`, total degree `d=87`, and uniform affine-line-then-point sampling, acceptance at least

\[
\varepsilon=3334045178670124/10^{16}
\]

forces one total-degree-at-most-87 polynomial to agree with the point table on at least `724940343` points. The score is `7249403422`, improving the verified record by `100087013`. The new step retunes researcher-0004’s component potential from a `28291`-incidence credit to `6861826`.

## Test and Notation

Let `h=p+1=147458`, `M=p²=21743566849`, `Λ=p(p+1)=21743714306`, and `N=Mh=3206262880419842`. Acceptance is `rho=|E|/N`. Use

\[
D=15136,  q=15049,  k=4414,  E_D=2618012,
\]

three complete directions plus 408 lines of a fourth direction, and 3776 added point labels.

## Prior Results

The verified incumbent is `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0003/response.json`. The selector, interpolation, cleanup, and C4 modules retuned here are from `research_state/campaign-10-frugal/submissions/researcher-0004/response.json`. Reconstruction uses the exact hypotheses of Lemmas 2.5, 2.7, and 6.1 in the [KTZ primary report](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/147/revision/1/download/).

## Theorem

Every point table and degree-at-most-87 affine-line table over `F_147457` accepted with probability at least `epsilon` admit one `Q∈F_147457[X,Y]` of total degree at most 87 satisfying

\[
\Pr[Q=f]\ge\max\{174/147457,\varepsilon/10\},
\]

and in fact agreeing at at least `724940343` points.

## Proof

[P1, proved] The partial-direction miss envelope is strictly log-concave and maximized at pencil degree `49122`. Its coefficient, after the top-3776 point constraints, is

\[
\kappa'_4=1246437422331006215441194309538667/
8421304329489870366247361127538688.
\]

[P2, proved] There are `6702349500` weighted monomials and `6702349499` imposed equations. Minimum weighted degree therefore gives a squarefree, Z-dependent relation of weight at most `15136` with nonzero Z-derivative. Identity extension and projective-discriminant cleanup give the losses `15136(Λ−t)`, `pz` with `z≤2618012`, and `15049(t−z)`.

[P3, proved] Set

\[
a_0=11/334,  \eta_1=527/50000,  \eta_2=13/200000000,
\quad \tau=7249403422/(10M).
\]

For `delta=D/h`, `theta=k/p`, maximizing centered affine mixing over the line density reduces the desired potential bound to `L_eta(a)≥0` and `R_eta(a)≥0`. At `(eta1,a0)`,

\[
L=965080609567916722203/167327978822000848750000000>0,
\]

\[
R=278412523909059/90780007227550000>0.
\]

At `(eta2,tau)`,

\[
L=51762097687883603297254119/
5909863897761863270450000000000000000>0,
\]

\[
R=2755970527215478145853/801565720104960500000000>0.
\]

The corresponding `Q_eta` and `2(delta−eta)−1` are negative in both ranges, so these right-endpoint checks certify the full intervals.

[P4, proved] Every nonempty peeled component contains at least `4415` points. The two range credits are

\[
K_1=\lceil\eta_1h·4415\rceil=6861826,
\quad K_2=\lceil\eta_2Na_0\rceil=6863707.
\]

The empty-core C4 credit is `133070051`. Hence every no-large-component graph receives the uniform credit `K=6861826`.

[P5, proved] The pre-credit fixed charge is `752643629192070`, so

\[
C=752643622330244.
\]

The no-large-component frontier is

\[
R=(C/N+\kappa'_4)/(1+\kappa'_4),
\quad \lfloor MR\rfloor=7249403421.
\]

Thus acceptance at least `7249403422/M` forces a component of density at least `tau`. KTZ lifting and simple-root propagation give one degree-87 polynomial throughout it.

[P6, proved] The terminating epsilon lies less than `1/N` below `7249403422/M`; indeed

\[
N(7249403422/M-\varepsilon)=182237457224949/1250000000000000<1.
\]

The acceptance lattice therefore upgrades `rho≥epsilon` to `rho≥7249403422/M`. Also `ceil(M epsilon)=7249403422`, `epsilon/10>174/p`, and the component contains at least `ceil(7249403422/10)=724940343` points.

## Counterexample Attempts

Upward decimal rounding causes an exact one-score metadata error. Concentrated directions attain the selector envelope but do not violate it. Inseparability is excluded by `deg_Z<p`, and branch switching is removed with derivative-zero incidences.

## Characteristic Audit

All derivative and restriction degrees are below `p`; the discriminant uses no leading-coefficient division; reconstruction divides only by nonzero `B_Z`; total degree remains 87.

## Limitations

The next score needs credit `7025388`, while the same centered-mixing potential endpoint caps this architecture below `7023216`. A stronger incidence inequality or another ledger saving is required. Both requested checkpoint writes were attempted, but the managed read-only sandbox rejected them.

## Team Handoff

Builder 0007 should import the balanced potential module; red-team 0009 should audit its endpoint fractions; integrator 0010 should use the exact terminating trigger, score, and recovery count above.
18:T5f2,Set $D=15129$. The number of monomials $X^iY^jZ^z$ satisfying $i+j+87z\leq D$ is

$$V_D=\sum_{z=0}^{173}\binom{D-87z+2}{2}=6693082347.$$

Each selected line graph imposes at most $D+1=15130$ homogeneous coefficient constraints. The $3$ direction classes contain

$$3\cdot147457=442371$$

lines, so they impose at most

$$442371\cdot15130=6693073230<V_D$$

constraints. Linear algebra therefore supplies a nonzero polynomial $A$ of the required weighted degree satisfying every selected formal line identity.

A nonzero $Z$-independent interpolant would have total degree at most $15129$ and vanish formally on $442371>15129$ distinct affine lines, contradicting Kominers–Thaler–Zheng Lemma $2.5$. Thus $A$ depends on $Z$. Since

$$\deg_Z(A)\leq 173<147457,$$

ordinary differentiation gives $A_Z\not\equiv0$.

Choose an eligible $A$ of minimum weighted degree. Suppose an irreducible factor $F$ occurs with multiplicity $e\geq2$, and write $A=F^eG$ with $F\nmid G$. On each selected line, the substituted identity lies in the integral domain $\mathbb{F}_{147457}[t]$; hence replacing $F^eG$ by $F^{e-1}G$ preserves that identity.

If $\deg_Z(F)=0$, then

$$A_Z=F^eG_Z,$$

so $(F^{e-1}G)_Z=F^{e-1}G_Z$ remains nonzero. If $\deg_Z(F)>0$, then $e\leq173<147457$, $F_Z\not\equiv0$, and irreducibility gives $F\nmid F_Z$. Modulo $F$, the derivative of $F^{e-1}G$ contains the nonzero term

$$(e-1)F_ZG.$$

Thus the reduced interpolant again has nonzero $Z$-derivative, contradicting minimality. Therefore $A$ is squarefree.19:T5c1,Write

$$h_0=\deg(H),\qquad W=\operatorname{wdeg}(B),\qquad \nu=\deg_Z(B).$$

Then

$$h_0+W\leq15129,\qquad 1\leq\nu\leq173<147457.$$

The polynomial $B$ is squarefree. Primitivity excludes $Z$-independent irreducible factors. Every positive-$Z$-degree irreducible factor has nonzero $Z$-derivative because its $Z$-degree is below $147457$. Consequently,

$$\gcd(B,B_Z)=1.$$

For $\nu\geq2$, the nominal projective $Z$-discriminant $\Delta_B(X,Y)$ is nonzero and has $(X,Y)$-degree at most

$$(\nu-1)(2W-87\nu).$$

If a noncontent identity line also satisfies $B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))\equiv0$, the homogenized specialization has the repeated finite projective root $[P_L(t):1]$. Thus $\Delta_B$ vanishes formally on that line. This argument does not invert the specialized leading coefficient and remains valid when that coefficient collapses.

The number of content and derivative-degenerate identity lines is therefore at most

$$h_0+(\nu-1)(2W-87\nu)\leq h_0+(\nu-1)\bigl(2(15129-h_0)-87\nu\bigr).$$

For $\nu\geq2$, this expression is maximized at $h_0=0$ and $\nu=173$, where it equals

$$172(30258-15051)=2615604.$$

If $\nu=1$, write $B=b_1(X,Y)Z+b_0(X,Y)$. A noncontent derivative-degenerate identity line would divide both $b_1$ and $b_0$, contradicting primitivity; the content-line count is smaller than $2615604$.

On every remaining identity line, $B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree at most

$$15129-87=15042,$$

and hence has at most $15042$ roots.1a:T74f,Put

$$p=147457,\quad M=21743566849,\quad \Lambda=21743714306,\quad N=3206262880419842,$$

$$D=15129,\quad q_{\mathrm{der}}=15042,\quad s=5195,\quad k=5194,$$

$$E_D=2615604,\quad K_4=156513678.$$

Let $t=|T|$ and let $e\leq E_D$ be the number of exceptional lines in $T$. Suppose the cleanup and peeling process empties the graph. Exceptional lines account for at most $pe$ accepted incidences, and derivative cleanup accounts for at most $q_{\mathrm{der}}(t-e)$ incidences. The affine point-line incidence graph contains no cycle of length $4$, so the credited peeling bound gives

$$|E_T|\leq pe+q_{\mathrm{der}}(t-e)+DM+k(t-e)-K_4.$$

Combining this with the identity-extension inequality yields

$$|E|\leq U_R+D\Lambda+DM+(s-88)t+(p-q_{\mathrm{der}}-s+1)e-K_4.$$

Both variable coefficients are positive:

$$s-88=5107,
\qquad p-q_{\mathrm{der}}-s+1=127221.$$

Using $t\leq\Lambda$ and $e\leq E_D$ therefore gives

$$|E|\leq U_R+C^*,$$

where

$$C^*=(q_{\mathrm{der}}+s-1)\Lambda+DM+(p-q_{\mathrm{der}}-s+1)E_D-K_4$$

and

$$C^*=440005802696216+328958422858521+332759756484-156513678=769296828797543.$$

Let

$$\epsilon=\frac{7349491214}{21743566849},\qquad \kappa=\frac{1610629120}{10871857153}.$$

The three-direction coverage bound implies that complete deletion at acceptance at least $\epsilon$ would force

$$\epsilon\leq\frac{C^*}{N}+\kappa(1-\epsilon).$$

However,

$$\frac{C^*}{N}+\kappa(1-\epsilon)=\frac{9400308072378016503}{27810935621062861282},$$

while

$$\epsilon-\frac{C^*}{N}-\kappa(1-\epsilon)=\frac{1249813349}{27810935621062861282}>0.$$

This contradiction proves that the core is nonempty. Peeling leaves point degrees at least $15130$ and line degrees at least $5195$. All retained lines are noncontent, nondegenerate identity lines, so they carry formal $B$-identities, and derivative cleanup ensures $B_Z(x,f(x))\neq0$ on every retained edge.1b:T533,Let $a$ and $b$ be the point and line densities of a connected core component. Put

$$\alpha=\frac{15130}{147458}=\frac{445}{4337},\qquad \beta=\frac{5195}{147457},$$

$$c=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{13123673}{4506143},\qquad \gamma^2=\frac{1}{c\cdot147458}=\frac{1039}{446204882}.$$

The minimum degrees imply that the component edge density is at least $\alpha a$ and at least $\beta b$. If $b\leq ca$, the affine-mixing upper bound is maximized over this range at $b=ca$ whenever $ca<1/2$. If $b\geq ca$, divide the mixing bound by $b$ and use the monotonicity of $(1-b)/b$. Both cases give the necessary inequality

$$\beta\leq a+\gamma\sqrt{(1-a)(1-ca)}.$$

Set

$$\tau=\frac{3674745607}{108717834245}$$

and

$$F(a)=(\beta-a)^2-\gamma^2(1-a)(1-ca).$$

Exact arithmetic gives

$$\beta-\tau=\frac{155449968}{108717834245}>0,$$

$$\frac12-c\tau=\frac{2668206923709}{6644623283510}>0,$$

$$F(\tau)=\frac{498727149435244}{30939665878432433176225}>0,$$

and

$$F'(\tau)=-\frac{13793284387}{4837976433085}<0.$$

Moreover,

$$F''=2\left(1-\frac{1}{147458}\right)>0.$$

Thus $F'$ is negative throughout $[0,\tau]$, and consequently $F(a)\geq F(\tau)>0$ whenever $a\leq\tau$. On that interval, $\beta-a>0$ and $ca<1/2$, so the necessary component inequality would give $F(a)\leq0$ after squaring. This contradiction shows that $a>\tau$.1c:T44d,Give $X,Y,Z$ weights $(1,1,87)$ and put $D=15129$. The number of monomials of weighted degree at most $D$ is

$$V_D=\sum_{z=0}^{173}\binom{D-87z+2}{2}=6693082347.$$

Each selected formal line identity imposes at most $D+1=15130$ coefficient equations, whereas

$$442371\cdot15130=6693073230<V_D.$$

Rank-nullity therefore gives a nonzero interpolant $A$. A $Z$-independent interpolant would be a bivariate polynomial of degree at most $D$ divisible by the distinct equations of $442371>D$ affine lines, which is impossible. Thus $A$ depends on $Z$. Since $\deg_Z(A)\le173<p$, ordinary differentiation gives $A_Z\not\equiv0$.

Choose a nonzero interpolant of minimum weighted degree. If an irreducible factor $F$ occurred twice, write $A=F^2G$. Specialization to a selected line takes place in the integral domain $\mathbb F_p[t]$. Since the specialization of $F^2G$ is zero, either the specialization of $F$ or that of $G$ is zero, and in either case the quotient $FG$ still specializes to zero. This would give a nonzero interpolant of lower weighted degree, a contradiction. Hence $A$ is squarefree.1d:T67e,Write $A=CB$, where $C\in\mathbb F_p[X,Y]$ is the coefficient content in $Z$ and $B$ is primitive in $Z$. Put

$$c_0=\deg C,\qquad W=\operatorname{wdeg}(B),\qquad \nu=\deg_Z(B).$$

Weighted leading forms do not cancel, so

$$c_0+W=\operatorname{wdeg}(A)\le D.$$

The polynomial $B$ is squarefree and $1\le\nu\le173<p$. Primitivity excludes $Z$-independent irreducible factors. Every irreducible factor therefore has nonzero $Z$-derivative, and squarefreeness gives

$$\gcd(B,B_Z)=1.$$

For $\nu\ge2$, the nominal-degree discriminant is nonzero. Its monomials have degree $2\nu-2$ in the coefficients and coefficient-index weight $\nu(\nu-1)$, so its $(X,Y)$-degree is at most

$$(\nu-1)(2W-87\nu).$$

If a noncontent identity line also makes $B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))$ vanish formally, the homogenized nominal-degree binary form has a singular finite root. Euler's identity is valid because $\nu<p$, so the specialized nominal discriminant vanishes; no leading coefficient is inverted. The number of content or derivative-degenerate identity lines is therefore at most

$$c_0+(\nu-1)(2W-87\nu)\le(\nu-1)(2D-87\nu).$$

The last expression increases through $\nu=173$, since its consecutive difference is $2(D-87\nu)>0$ for $\nu\le172$. Its maximum is

$$172(2\cdot15129-87\cdot173)=2615604.$$

For $\nu=1$, the defining equation of a derivative-degenerate noncontent identity line would divide both coefficients of the primitive linear polynomial, which is impossible. The content-line count is at most $D-87<2615604$.

On every remaining identity line, $B_Z(L(t),P_L(t))$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree at most

$$q=D-87=15042,$$

and hence has at most $15042$ roots.1e:T691,Put

$$D=15129,\quad q=15042,\quad s=5195,\quad b=s-1=5194,$$

$$M=21743566849,\quad \Lambda=21743714306,\quad N=3206262880419842,$$

and $E_D=2615604$. Let $t=|T|$, and let $e\le E_D$ be the number of exceptional identity lines. Delete every accepted edge on those $e$ lines, at a cost of at most $pe$, and delete the at most $q$ derivative-zero edges on each remaining identity line. The resulting affine-incidence subgraph is $C_4$-free, so the empty-core bound applies with $n=t-e$.

If the $(15130,5195)$-core were empty, the identity-transfer, cleanup, and peeling bounds would give

$$|E|\le U_R+D(\Lambda-t)+pe+q(t-e)+DM+b(t-e)-\kappa.$$

After collection, the coefficients of $t$ and $e$ are respectively

$$q+b-D=s-88=5107>0$$

and

$$p-q-b=p-q-s+1=127221>0.$$

Using $t\le\Lambda$ and $e\le E_D$ therefore yields

$$|E|\le U_R+C_*,$$

where

$$C_*=(q+s-1)\Lambda+DM+(p-q-s+1)E_D-\kappa$$

$$=440005802696216+328958422858521+332759756484-156513678$$

$$=769296828797543.$$

The three-direction coverage bound, with $K=1610629120/10871857153$, then implies under complete deletion that

$$\rho\le R_0:=\frac{C_*/N+K}{1+K}=\frac{1244293905093223}{3681259956715522}.$$

Exact cross multiplication gives

$$\frac{7349491213}{M}\le R_0<\frac{7349491214}{M}.$$

At

$$\varepsilon=\frac{7349491214}{M},$$

the margin in the unrearranged survival inequality is

$$\varepsilon-\frac{C_*}{N}-K(1-\varepsilon)=\frac{1249813349}{27810935621062861282}>0.$$

Complete deletion is therefore impossible at density at least $\varepsilon$. The surviving core has the asserted minimum degrees; its lines are regular primitive identity lines, and the derivative-zero incidences were deleted.1f:T66e,Let $X$ and $S$ be the point and line vertex sets of a connected core component. Put $a=|X|/M$, let $\ell=|S|/\Lambda$, and write $m_L=|X\cap L|$. Ordered-pair counting gives

$$\sum_Lm_L=h|X|,\qquad \sum_Lm_L^2=|X|^2+p|X|.$$

Consequently,

$$\sum_L(m_L-ap)^2=p^3a(1-a).$$

Centering the indicator of $S$ and applying Cauchy-Schwarz yields

$$\frac{I(X,S)}{N}\le a\ell+\sqrt{\frac{a(1-a)\ell(1-\ell)}{h}}.$$

Define

$$\alpha=\frac{15130}{147458}=\frac{445}{4337},\qquad \beta=\frac{5195}{147457},$$

$$c=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{13123673}{4506143},\qquad \gamma^2=\frac{1}{ch}=\frac{1039}{446204882}.$$

The minimum point and line degrees imply that the retained-edge density is at least $\alpha a$ and at least $\beta\ell$. Put

$$\tau=\frac{\varepsilon}{10}=\frac{3674745607}{108717834245}.$$

The exact sign checks

$$\beta-\tau=\frac{155449968}{108717834245}>0$$

and

$$\frac12-c\tau=\frac{2668206923709}{6644623283510}>0$$

show that, if $a\le\tau$, then $\beta-a>0$ and $ca<1/2$. Splitting according to $\ell\le ca$ or $\ell\ge ca$ in the incidence upper bound gives the necessary condition

$$\beta\le a+\gamma\sqrt{(1-a)(1-ca)}.$$

Define

$$F(a)=(\beta-a)^2-\gamma^2(1-a)(1-ca).$$

The necessary condition would imply $F(a)\le0$. However,

$$F(\tau)=\frac{498727149435244}{30939665878432433176225}>0,$$

$$F'(\tau)=-\frac{13793284387}{4837976433085}<0,$$

and

$$F''=2\left(1-\frac1h\right)>0.$$

Thus $F'$ is negative throughout $[0,\tau]$, and $F(a)\ge F(\tau)>0$ there, a contradiction. Hence $a>\tau$ for every component. Finally,

$$\tau M=734949121.4,$$

so the integral point count of every component is at least $734949122$.20:T5ba,Choose a point $x_0$ in a retained component and translate it to the origin. Put

$$a_0=f(x_0),\qquad c_1=B_Z(0,0,a_0)\ne0.$$

Construct homogeneous polynomials $Q_1,\ldots,Q_{87}$ recursively. If

$$a_0+Q_1+\cdots+Q_{n-1}$$

solves $B=0$ modulo $(X,Y)^n$, then adding a homogeneous polynomial $Q_n$ changes the degree-$n$ residual by $c_1Q_n$. Division by the retained nonzero scalar $c_1$ uniquely cancels that residual. Set

$$Q=a_0+Q_1+\cdots+Q_{87}.$$

At least $D+1=15130$ retained line labels pass through $x_0$. Each is a formal root of $B$ with the same simple constant value $a_0$. The one-variable version of the recursion shows that its coefficients through degree $87$ equal those of the restriction of $Q$ to the line. Both polynomials have degree at most $87$, so they are identical.

The polynomial $B(X,Y,Q(X,Y))$ has total degree at most the weighted degree $D=15129$. It vanishes formally on the $D+1$ distinct seed lines. Their distinct linear equations divide it, so a polynomial of degree at most $D$ with these $D+1$ line factors must vanish identically:

$$B(X,Y,Q(X,Y))\equiv0.$$

At an accepted simple intersection of a recovered line with a new retained line, the restriction of $Q$ and the new line label are formal roots with the same constant value. The same simple-root recursion makes them identical. Connectivity propagates the fixed polynomial $Q$ throughout the component, and acceptance gives $Q(x)=f(x)$ at every component point.21:T490,The interpolation-dimension lemma and rank-nullity give a nonzero element of the kernel. Any kernel element independent of $Z$ has ordinary degree at most $17642$ and vanishes identically on every selected affine line. The defining affine-linear polynomial of each line therefore divides it. Since the $600782$ lines are distinct and $600782>17642$, such a nonzero polynomial cannot exist. Thus every nonzero kernel element depends on $Z$.

The weighted-degree bound gives

$$\deg_Z(A)\le \left\lfloor\frac{17642}{87}\right\rfloor=202<147457.$$

All positive exponents of $Z$ are therefore nonzero in $\mathbb F_{147457}$, so $Z$-dependence implies $A_Z\ne0$.

Choose a nonzero kernel element $A$ of minimum weighted degree. If $A=G^eH$ for an irreducible $G$ and $e\ge2$, then on each selected line graph

$$G(L(t),P_L(t))^eH(L(t),P_L(t))=0$$

in the domain $\mathbb F[t]$. For that line, either $G(L(t),P_L(t))=0$ or $H(L(t),P_L(t))=0$, so $A/G$ also vanishes identically on every selected graph. Its weighted degree is strictly smaller, contradicting the choice of $A$. Hence $A$ is squarefree. All vanishings used here are coefficient identities in $\mathbb F[t]$.22:T556,Translate $b$ to the origin and retain the notation $B$ for the translated polynomial. Translation does not increase weighted degree. Put $\mathfrak m=(X,Y)$ and

$$c=B_Z(0,0,a)\ne0.$$

Starting with the constant $a$, construct homogeneous polynomials $h_n$ of degree $n$ for $1\le n\le87$. Suppose $a+h_1+\cdots+h_{n-1}$ solves $B=0$ modulo $\mathfrak m^n$, and let $R_n$ be the homogeneous degree-$n$ part of its residual. Adding a homogeneous polynomial $h_n$ changes that part by exactly $ch_n$. The unique choice

$$h_n=-c^{-1}R_n$$

therefore gives a solution modulo $\mathfrak m^{n+1}$. This recursion divides only by $c$ and uses no factorials.

Set

$$Q=a+h_1+\cdots+h_{87}.$$

On a seed line $L_i(t)=tv_i$, the univariate form of the same recursion shows that $Q(L_i(t))$ and $P_i(t)$ have identical coefficients through degree $87$. Both have degree at most $87$, so

$$Q(L_i(t))=P_i(t).$$

Now set $R(X,Y)=B(X,Y,Q(X,Y))$. Substitution of a polynomial of total degree at most $87$ into a monomial of weight at most $17642$ gives total degree at most $17642$, so $\deg(R)\le17642$. The polynomial $R$ vanishes identically on the $17643$ distinct seed lines. Their distinct affine-linear defining polynomials divide $R$, which is impossible for a nonzero polynomial of degree at most $17642$. Thus $R=0$. Translating back yields the asserted polynomial $Q$.23:T525,Choose a point vertex $b$ of $K$. Its degree supplies $17643$ distinct incident lines. Their accepted labels have the common value $f(b)$ at $b$, and $B_Z(b,f(b))\ne0$. The seed-globalization lemma therefore gives a polynomial $Q$ of total degree at most $87$ agreeing with those seed labels and satisfying $B(X,Y,Q)=0$.

A bipartite path between two line vertices of $K$ yields a path in the line-transition graph: every intervening point is incident to both adjacent lines, both incidences are accepted, and the common root is simple there. Connectedness of $K$ and line-component propagation therefore give $Q|_L=P_L$ for every line vertex. Every point vertex has an incident recovered line, so acceptance gives $Q(x)=f(x)$ at every point vertex. No incidence or agreement loss occurs.

For the recorded candidate arithmetic, $p^2=21743566849$ and

$$0.35922904602094702\,p^2=7810920776+\frac{25895898365733998}{10^{17}},$$

so the configured score is $7810920777$. For

$$\varepsilon_*=\frac{7810919590}{21743566849},$$

one has $\varepsilon_*p^2=7810919590$ and

$$\frac{\varepsilon_*}{10}=\frac{781091959}{21743566849}.$$

The candidate score is therefore smaller by $1187$. This arithmetic records compatibility with the zero-loss algebraic conclusion but does not establish the candidate's other dependencies.24:T5c4,Put $p=147457$, $d=87$, $N=p^2$, and $c=dp=12828759$. Let $Q_1,\ldots,Q_r$ be the polynomials counted by $R_K(f)$. For $i\ne j$, the nonzero polynomial $Q_i-Q_j$ has total degree at most $87$, so it has at most $c$ zeros in $\mathbb F^2$.

For each $x\in\mathbb F^2$, let $n_x$ count the list members agreeing with $f$ at $x$, and put $I=\sum_x n_x$. Pair counting and Cauchy--Schwarz give

$$\sum_x\binom{n_x}{2}\le\binom r2c$$

and

$$\sum_x\binom{n_x}{2}\ge\frac12\left(\frac{I^2}{N}-I\right).$$

Set

$$\alpha=\frac KN,\qquad \delta=\frac cN,\qquad B=\frac{\alpha-\delta}{\alpha^2-\delta}.$$

The proposed bound satisfies $B\ge 1/(2\alpha)$. If $r>B$, then $I\ge r\alpha N>N/2$. Since $z^2/N-z$ is increasing on the relevant interval, substituting $I\ge r\alpha N$ into the preceding inequalities yields

$$r\alpha^2-\alpha\le(r-1)\delta.$$

Hence $r\le B$, a contradiction. Therefore

$$r\le\left\lfloor\frac{N(K-c)}{K^2-cN}\right\rfloor.$$

For $K_3=\lceil3N/100\rceil=652307006$, the exact margins are

$$N(K_3-c)-94(K_3^2-cN)=127761602101311073>0$$

and

$$N(K_3-c)-95(K_3^2-cN)=-18799849069162572<0,$$

so the bound is $94$. At $K=781092078$, the corresponding margins for $50$ and $51$ are respectively

$$146692063903727181>0$$

and

$$-184469791504420512<0,$$

so the bound is $50$. The smallest integer $K$ for which $K^2-cN>0$ is $528150527$. For $K_{86}=\lceil N/86\rceil=252832173$,

$$K_{86}^2-cN=-215018871202308462,$$

so the hypothesis does not hold there.25:T40e,For each polynomial $Q$, put

$$A_Q=\{x\in\mathbb F^2:f(x)=Q(x)\},$$

and let

$$T=\bigcup_{Q\in\mathcal L_K(f)}A_Q.$$

Apply the fixed-overwrite lemma to obtain $\widetilde f$ equal to $f$ outside $T$ such that every total-degree-at-most-$87$ polynomial agrees with $\widetilde f$ on at most $s-1$ points of $T$, where $s=493416$.

If $Q\notin\mathcal L_K(f)$, it has at most $K-1$ agreements with $f$ outside $T$ and at most $s-1$ agreements with $\widetilde f$ inside $T$. If $Q\in\mathcal L_K(f)$, it has no agreements with $\widetilde f=f$ outside $T$ and at most $s-1$ inside $T$. Thus every $Q$ agrees with $\widetilde f$ on at most

$$K+s-2\le H-1$$

points.

Every unexplained point lies outside $T$, where $\widetilde f=f$. If more than $uN$ such points were $\beta$-good, their retained accepted incidences would give the overwritten table acceptance greater than $\beta u\ge\sigma$. The weak-recovery hypothesis would then produce a polynomial with at least $H$ agreements with $\widetilde f$, contradicting the preceding cap.26:T541,For a point set $S\subseteq\mathbb F^2$ of density $a$, let $Y=|S\cap L|$ for a uniformly random affine line $L$. Every point lies on $p+1$ lines, and every ordered pair of distinct points determines one line. Hence

$$\mathbb E[Y]=ap$$

and

$$\mathbb E[Y(Y-1)]=\frac{|S|(|S|-1)}{p(p+1)}.$$

Consequently,

$$\operatorname{Var}(Y/p)=\frac{a(1-a)}{p+1}.$$

Assume that every candidate has agreement density $a_i<\gamma$. Call $L$ abnormal if $|A_i\cap L|/p\ge\gamma+t$ for some $i$. Since $a_i(1-a_i)<\gamma(1-\gamma)$, Cantelli's inequality and a union bound give

$$\Pr[L\text{ is abnormal}]<\frac{r\gamma(1-\gamma)}{\gamma(1-\gamma)+(p+1)t^2}.$$

Call $L$ standard if $P_L$ equals $Q_i$ restricted to $L$ for some $i$. A normal standard line contributes less than $\gamma+t$ acceptance. On a nonstandard line, every restriction $P_L-Q_i|_L$ is a nonzero univariate polynomial of degree at most $87$, so the accepted points explained by the list occupy at most $87r/p$ of the line. Unexplained $\beta$-good points contribute at most $u$ to the incidence density, while all accepted incidences at points that are not $\beta$-good contribute less than $\beta$.

These cases cover every accepted incidence and yield

$$\rho<\gamma+t+\frac{r\gamma(1-\gamma)}{\gamma(1-\gamma)+147458t^2}+\frac{87r}{147457}+\beta+u,$$

contradicting the hypothesis.27:T455,Put

$$E_1=\frac{7810920776}{21743566849},\qquad \gamma=\frac{E_1}{10}=\frac{3905460388}{108717834245},\qquad t=\frac7{200}.$$

Enumerate the list as $Q_1,\ldots,Q_r$, where $r\le90$. Since

$$\gamma<\frac9{250}<\frac12,$$

one has

$$\gamma(1-\gamma)<\frac{2169}{62500}.$$

The abnormal-line term in the affine list-to-one lemma is therefore at most

$$B=\frac{90\cdot\frac{2169}{62500}}{\frac{2169}{62500}+147458\left(\frac7{200}\right)^2}=\frac{1561680}{90335377},$$

and the nonstandard-line coincidence term is at most

$$\frac{87\cdot90}{147457}=\frac{7830}{147457}.$$

Thus

$$\lambda=\frac7{200}+B+\frac{7830}{147457}=\frac{280765415738023}{2664116737257800}.$$

The definition of $b$ gives the exact identity

$$E_1=\gamma+\lambda+2b.$$

If no list member had agreement density at least $\gamma$, the affine list-to-one lemma, with $\beta=u=b$, would give

$$\rho<\gamma+\lambda+2b=E_1,$$

contrary to the acceptance hypothesis. Hence some candidate has at least $\gamma N$ agreements. Since

$$\gamma N=\frac{3905460388}{5}=781092077+\frac35,$$

its integral agreement count is at least $781092078$.28:T6c6,The $3\%$ threshold is

$$K_3=\left\lceil\frac{3N}{100}\right\rceil=652307006.$$

The Johnson entry gives list size at most $94$. With $r=94$ and $t=1/28$, the affine list-to-one parameters are

$$B_{94}=\frac{19980828}{1152228187},$$

$$\lambda_{94}=\frac{516242693665555}{4757315129572852},$$

and

$$b_{94}=\frac{753377354251711533937}{7014994170614240373640}.$$

The overwrite and weak-recovery reduction would require

$$H_3=K_3+493415=652800421$$

agreements at trigger $\sigma_{94}=b_{94}^2$, where

$$\sigma_{94}<\frac{29}{2500}.$$

Choose $86$ distinct values in $\mathbb F$ and sample each value $f(x)$ independently and uniformly from them. Every affine line has a most frequent value occurring at least

$$\left\lceil\frac{147457}{86}\right\rceil=1715$$

times. Label each line by the corresponding constant polynomial. The resulting acceptance is at least

$$\frac{1715}{147457}>\frac{29}{2500}>\sigma_{94}.$$

For any fixed total-degree-at-most-$87$ polynomial $Q$, the agreement indicators are independent Bernoulli variables with mean at most $1/86$. Since

$$\frac{H_3}{N}>\frac3{100}$$

and

$$\frac3{100}-\frac1{86}=\frac{79}{4300},$$

Hoeffding's inequality gives

$$\Pr\!\left[\left|\{x:f(x)=Q(x)\}\right|\ge H_3\right]<\exp\!\left(-2N\left(\frac{79}{4300}\right)^2\right).$$

There are $p^{3916}$ formal polynomials of total degree at most $87$. The inequalities $p<2^{18}$ and $\ln 2<1$, together with

$$2N\cdot79^2-18\cdot3916\cdot4300^2=270099878289218>0,$$

show that the union bound over all these polynomials is strictly below $1$. Hence some such table has acceptance greater than $\sigma_{94}$ but no total-degree-at-most-$87$ polynomial with $H_3$ agreements. This table refutes the stated implication.29:T43f,In HKSS v1 Lemma $B.4$, the printed hypothesis is

$$h(\beta_0'^2)\ge\max\left(\frac{e}{2\sqrt q},\frac{2(d+1)}q,\sqrt{\frac dq}\right).$$

The proof sets

$$\eta=\frac12h(\beta_0'^2)$$

but then invokes

$$\eta\ge\frac e{\sqrt q},\qquad \eta\ge\frac{4(d+1)}q,\qquad \eta\ge2\sqrt{\frac dq}.$$

These inequalities are four times the bounds supplied by the printed hypothesis. The written uses would be justified by the stronger sufficient condition

$$h(\beta_0'^2)\ge\max\left(\frac{2e}{\sqrt q},\frac{8(d+1)}q,4\sqrt{\frac dq}\right).$$

In HKSS v1 Lemma $B.6$, the cited list-cover property controls only unexplained $\beta$-good points. Accepted incidences at points below the goodness threshold require an additional loss of $\beta$. Independently, the four displayed case losses are

$$\eta_1+\beta,\qquad \beta,\qquad \beta,\qquad \beta,$$

whose sum is $\eta_1+4\beta$, not the claimed $\eta_1+3\beta$. Thus neither written numerical inference follows from the printed hypotheses and displayed case bounds. This refutes those inferences, not the possibility of a separate repair.2a:T7c2,The checker uses exact rational arithmetic. Put

All equalities and inequalities are checked after exact integer reduction, so no floating-point estimate enters the certificate.2b:T41e,Round 3 removes the inadmissible score-one route: the live cutoff is $957/(10p)>10/p$, and constant recovery $1/p$ is below the required floor $174/p$. The shortest indexed analytic chain is researcher-0003/P3--P10, which gives score $7349492138$. A single new parameter-specific $C_4$ peeling obligation at $(D,b)=(15129,5194)$ gives credit $156513678$, lowers the fixed charge to $769296828797543$, and yields the sharper canonical threshold $\varepsilon_\star=7349491214/21743566849$ with score $7349491214$: $924$ below the indexed candidate and $461429563$ below the comparison count. The unchanged component theorem supplies $734949214$ points, exceeding the new required $734949122$. This is the shortest plausible score-moving extension of the complete source chain. It is not verified: the new C4 statement has no exact stable source triple, researcher-0003's manifest failed static validation, all campaign-30 evidence entries have empty audit lists, the 42 Lemma Book entries are editorial only, and the authoritative leaderboard has no point.2c:T4cc,Round 3 deletes the score-one route because it violates the mandated cutoff and recovers fewer than the required $174p=25657518$ points. The shortest admissible indexed candidate is researcher-0003/P3--P10 at score $7349492138$. A new exact $C_4$ residual integer program for $(D,b)=(15129,5194)$ gives corner cap $646374$ and empty-core credit $156513678$. It lowers the fixed charge to $769296828797543$, the analytic boundary to $R_4=1244293905093223/3681259956715522$, and the normalized score to $7349491214$: $924$ below the indexed candidate and $461429563$ below the configured comparison count. Exact component arithmetic gives at least $734949122$ points, and indexed P9 supplies zero-loss recovery of one total-degree-at-most-$87$ polynomial. Incidence-lattice rounding permits the terminating trigger $0.3380076168821833$ without changing the score. The stable $(17642,5494)$ C4 lemmas and researcher-0004's $17643$-seed package are analogues only, not evidence for the new parameters. Every indexed audit list is empty and `double_accepted=false`; the new splice and final theorem are drafting activity, not verified progress. Promotion requires a stored exact checker/certificate and two matching verifier accepts.2d:T54c,The amended cutoff and recovery floor invalidate every score-one node from round 2, so those nodes were removed except for the reusable fixed-instance definition. The shortest admissible indexed candidate is researcher-0003/P3--P10: sharp three-direction coverage, a weighted-degree-$15129$ squarefree interpolant, identity transfer, primitive/discriminant cleanup, survival of a $(15130,5195)$ simple-root core, a centered-mixing component bound, and KTZ seed lifting plus propagation to one global polynomial. It proves the exact candidate $\varepsilon_*=7349492138/21743566849$ with at least $734949214$ agreement points. Exact conversion gives $\varepsilon_*>957/1474570$, $\varepsilon_*/10>174/147457$, and score $7349492138$, improving the comparison count $7810920777$ by $461428639$. This is the smallest $M$-aligned count certified by the displayed ledger, not a claim of global optimality. Every cited corpus step is author-marked proved but has an empty audit list and `double_accepted=false`; the researcher-0003 artifact also fails the current static contract because it records `claimed_soundness: 1.0` and omits the recovery fields. Historical double-accepted theorems inspected from earlier campaigns do not beat the comparison count. The goal therefore remains blocked pending a clean exact submission and two independent matching accepts.1:["$","$Ld",null,{"initialData":{"bottlenecks":[{"input_bound":"Accepted-incidence count |E|
